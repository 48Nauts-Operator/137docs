## üöÄ Quick-start (Local)

1. **Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/48Nauts-Operator/137docs.git
   cd 137docs
   ```
2. **Start the stack** (requires Docker Desktop):
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
   * Backend: http://localhost:8808
   * Frontend: http://localhost:3303
3. **Login** ‚Äì in dev mode any user who POSTs to `/api/auth/login` with the password `test` receives a JWT.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è  Without Docker you can also run the layers manually ‚Äì see *Development workflow* below.

---

## üõ† Development Workflow

### Prerequisites

* **Docker Desktop** ‚Äì Required for running the full stack
* **Git** ‚Äì For version control and repository management
* Optional: **VS Code** with Docker extension for easier container management

### Development Setup

1. **Clone and start the development environment**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/48Nauts-Operator/137docs.git
   cd 137docs
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. **Access the applications**:
   * **Frontend**: http://localhost:3303 (React + Vite dev server with hot reload)
   * **Backend**: http://localhost:8808 (FastAPI with auto-reload)
   * **Database**: PostgreSQL running internally (accessible via backend)
   * **Qdrant**: http://localhost:6333 (Vector database for embeddings)

3. **Development workflow**:
   ```bash
   # View logs for all services
   docker-compose logs -f
   
   # View logs for specific service
   docker-compose logs -f backend
   docker-compose logs -f frontend
   
   # Restart a specific service
   docker-compose restart backend
   
   # Rebuild after code changes
   docker-compose up --build
   
   # Stop all services
   docker-compose down
   ```

### Environment Configuration

Environment variables are configured in `docker-compose.yml` and `.env`:

**Backend Configuration**:
* `DATABASE_URL` ‚Äì PostgreSQL connection (auto-configured)
* `QDRANT_HOST` ‚Äì Vector database connection
* `OLLAMA_HOST` ‚Äì LLM service endpoint (default: host.docker.internal:11434)
* `LLM_MODEL` ‚Äì Default model name (default: llama3)
* `HOSTFS_MOUNT` ‚Äì Host filesystem mount point for document storage

**Frontend Configuration**:
* Automatically proxies `/api` calls to the backend
* Hot reload enabled for development
* Built with Vite for fast development experience

### Database Management

```bash
# Access database migrations
docker-compose exec backend alembic upgrade head

# Create new migration
docker-compose exec backend alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"

# View migration history
docker-compose exec backend alembic history

# Access PostgreSQL directly
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d docai
```

### File System Access

The application uses Docker volume mounts for persistent storage:
* `./data/inbox` ‚Üí Container inbox for document processing
* `./data/storage` ‚Üí Document archive and storage
* `./backups` ‚Üí Database backups

### External Dependencies

**Optional External Services**:
* **Ollama** ‚Äì For local LLM inference (install separately or use cloud APIs)
  ```bash
  # Install Ollama (macOS/Linux)
  curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
  
  # Pull recommended models
  ollama pull llama3
  ollama pull phi3
  ```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note**: All core functionality runs in Docker containers. External services like Ollama are optional and can be replaced with cloud API endpoints.

## üìÖ Calendar Sync

1. Open **Calendar** in the sidebar.
2. Click **"Sync / Export ICS"** ‚Äì the app will request a personal API key and open the URL:
   `https://<host>/api/calendar/export/ics?api_key=<your-token>`.
3. Copy that address into Google Calendar ("Add by URL") or Apple Calendar ("New subscription").

The feed is read-only & updated each time you add / update a document with a due date.

---

## üß™ Tests

*Backend* tests live in `src/backend/tests/` (pytest).

```bash
pytest -q
```

*Frontend* tests use React Testing Library: `npm test`.
