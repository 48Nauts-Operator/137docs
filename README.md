## üöÄ Quick-start (Local)

1. **Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/48Nauts-Operator/137docs.git
   cd 137docs
   ```
2. **Start the stack** (requires Docker Desktop):
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
   * Backend: http://localhost:8808
   * Frontend: http://localhost:3303
3. **Login** ‚Äì in dev mode any user who POSTs to `/api/auth/login` with the password `test` receives a JWT.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è  Without Docker you can also run the layers manually ‚Äì see *Development workflow* below.

---

## üõ† Development Workflow

### Prerequisites

* Python ‚â• 3.11  (see `requirements.txt`)
* Node ‚â• 18      (see `src/frontend/package.json`)
* An [Ollama](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama) instance for local LLM inference (or point `LLM_API_URL` to OpenAI etc.)

### Backend

```bash
cd src/backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Environment variables (defaults set in `docker-compose.yml`):
* `WATCH_FOLDER` ‚Äì directory watched for new files (default `./data/inbox`)
* `ARCHIVE_FOLDER` ‚Äì where processed files are moved
* `DATABASE_URL` ‚Äì SQLAlchemy URL, e.g. `sqlite:///./documents.db`
* `LLM_MODEL`, `LLM_API_URL` ‚Äì LLM config used by `app.llm`

### Frontend

```bash
cd src/frontend
npm install      # first run only
npm start        # CRA dev-server on :3000
```

The proxy is pre-configured to forward `/api` calls to the backend.

---

## üìÖ Calendar Sync

1. Open **Calendar** in the sidebar.
2. Click **"Sync / Export ICS"** ‚Äì the app will request a personal API key and open the URL:
   `https://<host>/api/calendar/export/ics?api_key=<your-token>`.
3. Copy that address into Google Calendar ("Add by URL") or Apple Calendar ("New subscription").

The feed is read-only & updated each time you add / update a document with a due date.

---

## üß™ Tests

*Backend* tests live in `src/backend/tests/` (pytest).

```bash
pytest -q
```

*Frontend* tests use React Testing Library: `npm test`.
