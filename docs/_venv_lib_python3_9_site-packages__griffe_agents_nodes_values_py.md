# AST Attribute Value Extraction Module

## Overview

This module provides utilities for extracting string representations of Python Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) nodes. It's designed to safely convert AST nodes back to their source code representation, with error handling and logging capabilities.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this module is to:
- Convert AST nodes back to readable Python code strings
- Provide safe extraction methods that handle exceptions gracefully
- Support debugging and logging when extraction fails
- Assist in code analysis and documentation generation workflows

## Functions

### `get_value(node: ast.AST | None) -> str | None`

Converts an AST node to its string representation using Python's built-in `ast.unparse()` function.

**Parameters:**
- `node`: The AST node to convert to string representation

**Returns:**
- String representation of the node's code, or `None` if the input node is `None`

**Example:**
```python
import ast
from your_module import get_value

# Parse some Python code
code = "x = 42"
tree = ast.parse(code)
assignment = tree.body[0]

# Get string representation
result = get_value(assignment)
print(result)  # Output: "x = 42"
```

### `safe_get_value(node: ast.AST | None, filepath: str | Path | None = None) -> str | None`

A safer version of `get_value()` that catches exceptions and logs errors instead of crashing.

**Parameters:**
- `node`: The AST node to convert to string representation
- `filepath`: Optional file path for better error reporting and debugging

**Returns:**
- String representation of the node's code, or `None` if extraction fails or input is `None`

**Example:**
```python
import ast
from pathlib import Path
from your_module import safe_get_value

# Parse potentially problematic code
try:
    tree = ast.parse(some_code)
    node = tree.body[0]
    result = safe_get_value(node, filepath=Path("example.py"))
except Exception:
    # safe_get_value won't raise, but this shows the safety aspect
    pass
```

## Dependencies

- **`ast`**: Python's built-in Abstract Syntax Tree module
- **`typing`**: For type hints and type checking support
- **`_griffe.logger`**: Custom logging functionality for error reporting

## Key Features

- **Safe execution**: The `safe_get_value()` function prevents crashes from malformed or problematic AST nodes
- **Enhanced error reporting**: When provided with a filepath, error messages include location information
- **Type safety**: Full type hints for better IDE support and code clarity
- **Null handling**: Both functions gracefully handle `None` inputs

## Notes and Suggestions

### Usage Recommendations

- **Use `safe_get_value()` in production code** where robustness is important
- **Use `get_value()` when you need exceptions** to propagate for debugging
- **Always provide filepath** to `safe_get_value()` when available for better error tracking

### Potential Improvements

- Consider adding configuration options for different unparsing styles
- Add support for partial node extraction when full unparsing fails
- Consider caching results for frequently accessed nodes
- Add validation for node types before attempting to unparse

### Error Handling

The module uses exception handling to catch any errors during the unparsing process. When errors occur:
- The exception is logged with contextual information
- Line numbers are included when available
- File paths are included when provided
- `None` is returned instead of raising the exception

This makes the module suitable for use in larger systems where individual parsing failures shouldn't crash the entire application.
