# Unicode Properties Documentation

## Overview

This file contains auto-generated Unicode property data for Unicode version 13.0.0. It provides mappings for Unicode character age properties, which indicate when specific characters were first introduced to the Unicode standard.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this module is to provide efficient lookups for:
- **Unicode Age Property**: Determining which Unicode version a character was first introduced in
- **ASCII Age Property**: Specifically tracking ASCII characters (U+0000 to U+007F)

This data is commonly used in:
- Text processing applications
- Unicode compliance testing
- Character validation and filtering
- Internationalization (i18n) libraries

## Data Structures

### `unicode_age: dict[str, str]`

A dictionary mapping Unicode version strings to character ranges that were introduced in that version.

**Key Format**: Unicode version number (e.g., "1.1", "13.0") or negated version (e.g., "^1.1")
**Value Format**: String containing Unicode character ranges in compressed format

#### Examples:
```python
# Characters introduced in Unicode 1.1
unicode_age["1.1"]  # Returns range string for basic Latin, etc.

# Characters NOT in Unicode 1.1 (everything added after)
unicode_age["^1.1"]  # Returns range string for post-1.1 characters
```

#### Key Patterns:
- **Positive keys** (e.g., "1.1"): Characters introduced in that specific version
- **Negative keys** (e.g., "^1.1"): Characters NOT in that version
- **"na"**: Characters with no assigned age property
- **"^na"**: Characters that DO have an assigned age property

### `ascii_age: dict[str, str]`

A simplified dictionary specifically for ASCII characters (U+0000-U+007F).

**Key Format**: Same as `unicode_age`
**Value Format**: String containing ASCII character ranges

#### Note:
Most entries are empty strings since ASCII characters were all defined in Unicode 1.1.

## Usage Examples

```python
# Check if a character was introduced in Unicode 1.1
if char in unicode_age["1.1"]:
    print("Character is from Unicode 1.1")

# Get all characters introduced in Unicode 13.0
new_chars = unicode_age["13.0"]

# Get all characters that existed before Unicode 2.0
pre_v2_chars = unicode_age["^2.0"]
```

## Important Notes

### Performance Considerations
- The character range strings are compressed and may require parsing for character-by-character lookups
- Consider using Unicode character property libraries for frequent lookups
- Data is optimized for storage size rather than query speed

### Data Format
- Character ranges are represented as compressed strings
- Unicode escapes are used for non-ASCII characters (e.g., `\u0100`, `\U00010000`)
- Ranges are typically in the format "start-end"

### Limitations
- This is auto-generated data and should not be manually edited
- Only covers Unicode version 13.0.0 and earlier
- Some entries may be empty if no characters were introduced in that version

## Maintenance

This file is auto-generated and should be regenerated when:
- Updating to a newer Unicode version
- Correcting Unicode data inconsistencies
- Changing the data format or compression scheme

**⚠️ Warning**: Do not manually edit this file as changes will be lost during regeneration.
