# Unicode Properties Module Documentation

## Overview

This module provides Unicode character property data for Unicode version 13.0.0. It contains pre-compiled dictionaries mapping Unicode version/age properties to character ranges, enabling efficient lookup and filtering of Unicode characters based on their introduction versions.

**Note:** This file is auto-generated and should not be manually edited.

## Purpose

The module serves as a reference for:
- Determining when specific Unicode characters were introduced
- Filtering text based on Unicode version compatibility
- Unicode version-aware text processing
- Character set validation against specific Unicode standards

## Data Structures

### `unicode_age: dict[str, str]`

Maps Unicode version identifiers to character ranges that were introduced in that version.

**Key Format:**
- `"X.Y"` - Characters introduced in Unicode version X.Y
- `"^X.Y"` - Characters NOT in Unicode version X.Y (complement set)
- `"na"` - Characters with no assigned age property
- `"^na"` - Characters that DO have an assigned age property

**Value Format:**
Character ranges are encoded as compact strings using Unicode escape sequences and range notation (`\uXXXX-\uYYYY`).

#### Examples

```python
# Characters introduced in Unicode 1.1
unicode_age["1.1"]  # Returns: "\x00-\u01f5\u01fa-\u0217..."

# Characters introduced in Unicode 13.0 (latest)
unicode_age["13.0"]  # Returns: "\u08be-\u08c7\u0b55\u0d04..."

# Characters NOT in Unicode 1.1 (everything added after)
unicode_age["^1.1"]  # Returns complement set

# Characters with no assigned age
unicode_age["na"]  # Returns unassigned characters
```

### `ascii_age: dict[str, str]`

Similar to `unicode_age` but focuses specifically on ASCII character ranges (0x00-0x7F).

**Key Characteristics:**
- Only Unicode 1.1 contains ASCII characters (`"\x00-\x7f"`)
- All other versions return empty strings for ASCII range
- Complement sets (`^X.Y`) return the full Unicode range

## Usage Examples

### Basic Version Lookup

```python
from unicode_properties import unicode_age

# Check if a character was available in Unicode 6.0
def is_unicode_6_0_compatible(char):
    char_code = ord(char)
    # Implementation would check if char_code falls within unicode_age["6.0"] ranges
    pass

# Get all characters introduced in Unicode 13.0
new_chars_13_0 = unicode_age["13.0"]
```

### Version Filtering

```python
def filter_by_unicode_version(text, max_version="6.0"):
    """Filter text to only include characters from specified Unicode version or earlier"""
    # Implementation would use unicode_age data to validate characters
    pass
```

### ASCII-Only Processing

```python
def is_ascii_only(text):
    """Check if text contains only ASCII characters (Unicode 1.1)"""
    ascii_chars = ascii_age["1.1"]  # "\x00-\x7f"
    # Implementation would validate against this range
    pass
```

## Important Notes

### Character Range Format
- Ranges use Unicode escape sequences (`\uXXXX`, `\UXXXXXXXX`)
- Multiple ranges are concatenated without separators
- Individual characters and ranges are mixed in the same string

### Version Progression
Unicode versions build upon each other:
- Characters in version X.Y are also available in all later versions
- Use complement sets (`^X.Y`) to find characters added after a specific version

### Performance Considerations
- These are raw string data structures
- For actual character matching, you'll need to parse the range strings
- Consider caching parsed ranges for frequently used versions

## Complementary Data

The module provides both positive and negative sets:
- `"1.1"` contains characters introduced in Unicode 1.1
- `"^1.1"` contains all characters NOT in Unicode 1.1
- This allows for efficient forward and backward compatibility checks

## Integration Suggestions

1. **Parse range strings** into actual character sets for runtime use
2. **Cache parsed data** to avoid repeated string processing
3. **Validate input** against specific Unicode version requirements
4. **Use for compatibility** checks in internationalization code

## Version Coverage

This module covers Unicode versions from 1.1 through 13.0, including all major and minor releases that introduced new characters or properties.
