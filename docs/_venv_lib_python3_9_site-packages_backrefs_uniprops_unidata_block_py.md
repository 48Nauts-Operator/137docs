# Unicode Properties Module

This module provides Unicode block definitions based on Unicode version 13.0.0. It contains mappings for all Unicode blocks and their character ranges, designed to be used in character matching and regular expression operations.

## Overview

The module defines Unicode character blocks as dictionaries mapping block names to their corresponding character ranges. It includes both full Unicode support and ASCII-only variants for different use cases.

## Module Contents

### Main Data Structures

#### `unicode_blocks: dict[str, str]`

A comprehensive dictionary containing all Unicode blocks defined in Unicode 13.0.0. Each entry maps a normalized block name to its character range string.

**Key Features:**
- Contains 338+ Unicode blocks
- Includes both positive and negative (complemented) ranges
- Character ranges use Unicode escape sequences
- Block names are normalized (lowercase, no spaces/hyphens)

**Example entries:**
```python
"basiclatin": "\x00-\x7f"
"^basiclatin": "\x80-\U0010ffff"  # Complement (everything except Basic Latin)
"greek": "\u0370-\u03ff"
"emoji": "\U0001f600-\U0001f64f"
```

#### `ascii_blocks: dict[str, str]`

A parallel dictionary with the same structure as `unicode_blocks`, but optimized for ASCII-only environments.

**Key Features:**
- Only "basiclatin" block contains actual ranges
- All other Unicode blocks map to empty strings
- Complemented blocks map to the full Unicode range
- Useful when Unicode support is limited

## Block Categories

The module includes blocks for various writing systems and symbol sets:

### Writing Systems
- **Latin Scripts**: `basiclatin`, `latin1supplement`, `latinextendeda`, `latinextendedb`, etc.
- **Asian Scripts**: `cjkunifiedideographs`, `hiragana`, `katakana`, `hangulsyllables`
- **Indian Scripts**: `devanagari`, `bengali`, `tamil`, `telugu`, etc.
- **Middle Eastern**: `arabic`, `hebrew`, `syriac`
- **Historical**: `cuneiform`, `egyptianhieroglyphs`, `lineara`

### Symbols and Special Characters
- **Mathematical**: `mathematicaloperators`, `supplementalmathematicaloperators`
- **Arrows**: `arrows`, `supplementalarrowsa`, `supplementalarrowsb`
- **Symbols**: `miscellaneoussymbols`, `dingbats`, `emoticons`
- **Technical**: `controlpictures`, `boxdrawing`, `blockelements`

### Special Blocks
- **Private Use**: `privateusearea`, `supplementaryprivateuseareaa`
- **Surrogates**: `highsurrogates`, `lowsurrogates`
- **No Block**: `noblock` - characters not assigned to any specific block

## Usage Examples

```python
from unicode_properties import unicode_blocks, ascii_blocks

# Get Basic Latin range (ASCII)
ascii_range = unicode_blocks["basiclatin"]  # "\x00-\x7f"

# Get everything except Basic Latin
non_ascii = unicode_blocks["^basiclatin"]   # "\x80-\U0010ffff"

# Check if a block exists
if "greek" in unicode_blocks:
    greek_range = unicode_blocks["greek"]

# For ASCII-only environments
ascii_only = ascii_blocks["basiclatin"]     # "\x00-\x7f"
unicode_only = ascii_blocks["greek"]        # "" (empty)
```

## Implementation Notes

### Block Name Normalization
- All block names are lowercase
- Spaces and hyphens are removed
- Example: "Basic Latin" becomes "basiclatin"

### Range Format
- Character ranges use hyphen notation: `\uXXXX-\uYYYY`
- Multiple ranges are concatenated: `\uXXXX-\uYYYY\uZZZZ-\uWWWW`
- Uses appropriate escape sequences (`\x`, `\u`, `\U`) based on code point values

### Complement Ranges
- Complemented block names are prefixed with `^`
- Represent all characters NOT in the specified block
- Useful for negative character classes in regex

## Performance Considerations

- **Memory Usage**: The dictionaries are pre-computed and stored as string literals
- **Lookup Speed**: O(1) dictionary access for any block name
- **Auto-generated**: This file is automatically generated, ensuring accuracy and completeness

## Compatibility

- **Python Version**: Requires Python 3.9+ (uses `dict[str, str]` type annotations)
- **Unicode Version**: Based on Unicode 13.0.0 specification
- **Encoding**: All character ranges support full Unicode code point space (U+0000 to U+10FFFF)

## Notes and Suggestions

⚠️ **Important Considerations:**

1. **Auto-generated File**: This file is automatically generated. Do not edit manually as changes will be overwritten.

2. **Memory Usage**: Both dictionaries contain extensive data. Consider lazy loading if memory is constrained.

3. **ASCII Fallback**: Use `ascii_blocks` when working in environments with limited Unicode support.

4. **Block Coverage**: The `noblock` entry contains characters not assigned to specific blocks in Unicode 13.0.0.

5. **Regular Expressions**: These ranges are designed for use in character classes within regular expressions.

**Example Integration:**
```python
import re
from unicode_properties import unicode_blocks

# Create regex for matching Latin characters
latin_pattern = f"[{unicode_blocks['basiclatin']}{unicode_blocks['latin1supplement']}]"
regex = re.compile(latin_pattern)
```
