# Unicode Properties Module Documentation

## Overview

This Python module provides Unicode canonical combining class properties from Unicode version 13.0.0. It contains auto-generated data structures that define character ranges for different canonical combining classes used in Unicode normalization and text processing.

## Purpose

The module serves as a reference for Unicode canonical combining classes, which are essential for:
- Text normalization (NFC, NFD, NFKC, NFKD)
- Proper text rendering and display
- Collation and sorting algorithms
- Unicode-aware text processing applications

## Data Structures

### `unicode_canonical_combining_class`

```python
unicode_canonical_combining_class: dict[str, str]
```

A comprehensive dictionary mapping canonical combining class values to their corresponding Unicode character ranges.

**Key Features:**
- **Keys**: String representations of combining class numbers (0-255) and their negations (^0-^255)
- **Values**: Unicode character ranges in compressed format using hyphens for ranges
- **Coverage**: Full Unicode character set from `\x00` to `\U0010ffff`

**Important Combining Classes:**
- `"0"`: Non-combining characters (most characters)
- `"1"`: Overlay characters
- `"7"`: Nukta characters (Indic scripts)
- `"8"`: Kana voicing marks
- `"9"`: Viramas (script joiners)
- `"10"-"199"`: Various diacritic marks with specific positioning
- `"200"-"240"`: Below, above, and overlay marks
- `"^X"`: Negated classes (characters NOT in class X)

### `ascii_canonical_combining_class`

```python
ascii_canonical_combining_class: dict[str, str]
```

A simplified version focusing on ASCII character ranges.

**Key Features:**
- **ASCII-only scope**: Optimized for ASCII text processing
- **Class "0"**: Contains the full Unicode range `"\x00-\U0010ffff"`
- **Other classes**: Mostly empty strings (no ASCII characters in those classes)
- **Negated classes**: Complement of the positive classes

## Usage Examples

```python
# Get all non-combining characters
non_combining = unicode_canonical_combining_class["0"]

# Get characters that are NOT in combining class 230 (above marks)
not_above_marks = unicode_canonical_combining_class["^230"]

# Check if working with ASCII-only text
ascii_non_combining = ascii_canonical_combining_class["0"]
```

## Character Range Format

The character ranges use Unicode escape sequences:
- `\x00-\x7f`: ASCII range
- `\u0000-\uffff`: Basic Multilingual Plane
- `\U00010000-\U0010ffff`: Supplementary planes

Ranges are represented as `start-end` pairs, with individual characters listed separately.

## Technical Notes

### Performance Considerations
- Large data structure - consider memory usage for memory-constrained applications
- Pre-compiled ranges for fast lookup operations
- Use `ascii_canonical_combining_class` for ASCII-only text processing

### Unicode Compliance
- Based on Unicode 13.0.0 specification
- Auto-generated data ensures accuracy and completeness
- Includes all canonical combining classes defined in Unicode standard

### Compatibility
- Requires Python 3.9+ (uses `dict[str, str]` type annotations)
- Compatible with `unicodedata` module operations
- Suitable for use with regex engines supporting Unicode

## Common Use Cases

1. **Text Normalization**: Identify combining marks for NFC/NFD operations
2. **Rendering Engines**: Determine character stacking and positioning
3. **Input Validation**: Verify proper combining character sequences
4. **Search/Replace**: Handle diacritics and combining marks correctly
5. **Font Rendering**: Position combining marks relative to base characters

## Suggestions

- Consider lazy loading if not all combining classes are needed
- Cache frequently accessed ranges for better performance
- Use appropriate data structure based on ASCII vs. full Unicode requirements
- Validate input ranges before processing to avoid errors
- Consider using set operations for range intersections and unions
