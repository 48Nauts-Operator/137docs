# Unicode Properties Module Documentation

## Overview

This module contains Unicode decomposition type properties extracted from Unicode version 13.0.0. It provides character ranges for various decomposition types used in Unicode text processing and normalization.

## Purpose

The module serves as a reference for Unicode character decomposition properties, which are essential for:

- Text normalization and canonicalization
- Character decomposition and composition operations
- Unicode-compliant text processing
- Font and rendering system implementations
- Character classification and analysis

## Key Data Structures

### `unicode_decomposition_type`

**Type:** `dict[str, str]`

A comprehensive dictionary mapping decomposition type names to their corresponding Unicode character ranges. The character ranges are represented as compact string patterns.

#### Key Categories:

- **Canonical decomposition types:**
  - `canonical` - Characters with canonical decomposition
  - `^canonical` - Characters WITHOUT canonical decomposition (negated)

- **Compatibility decomposition types:**
  - `compat` - Compatibility decomposition
  - `font` - Font variant decomposition
  - `circle` - Circled character variants
  - `square` - Squared character variants
  - `fraction` - Fractional number forms
  - `super` - Superscript variants
  - `sub` - Subscript variants
  - `vertical` - Vertical layout variants
  - `wide` - Full-width character variants
  - `narrow` - Half-width character variants
  - `small` - Small variant forms
  - `nobreak` - Non-breaking variants

- **Arabic presentation forms:**
  - `initial` - Initial form in Arabic script
  - `medial` - Medial form in Arabic script
  - `final` - Final form in Arabic script
  - `isolated` - Isolated form in Arabic script

- **Special category:**
  - `none` - Characters with no decomposition

### `ascii_decomposition_type`

**Type:** `dict[str, str]`

A simplified ASCII-compatible version of the decomposition type mappings. This appears to be a fallback or simplified representation where:

- Most negated types (`^*`) map to the full Unicode range (`\x00-\U0010ffff`)
- Most positive types map to empty strings
- The `none` type maps to the full Unicode range
- The `^none` type maps to an empty string

## Usage Examples

```python
# Check if a character has canonical decomposition
canonical_chars = unicode_decomposition_type["canonical"]

# Get characters that are NOT canonical
non_canonical_chars = unicode_decomposition_type["^canonical"]

# Access specific decomposition types
circled_chars = unicode_decomposition_type["circle"]
superscript_chars = unicode_decomposition_type["super"]
arabic_initial_forms = unicode_decomposition_type["initial"]
```

## Important Notes

### Character Range Format
- Character ranges are stored as compact Unicode string representations
- Ranges use Unicode escape sequences (e.g., `\u0100-\u01ff`)
- Some ranges extend into supplementary planes (e.g., `\U0001d400-\U0001d454`)

### Negated Categories
- Categories prefixed with `^` represent the complement (negation) of that category
- For example, `^canonical` contains all characters that do NOT have canonical decomposition

### Data Source
- **Auto-generated from Unicode 13.0.0**
- This is machine-generated data and should not be manually edited
- Updates should come from regenerating against newer Unicode versions

## Recommendations

1. **Performance Considerations:**
   - Consider converting string ranges to more efficient data structures for frequent lookups
   - Cache compiled regex patterns if using for character matching

2. **Unicode Version Awareness:**
   - Be aware this data is specific to Unicode 13.0.0
   - Newer Unicode versions may have different character classifications

3. **Integration:**
   - Use with Unicode normalization libraries (unicodedata, etc.)
   - Suitable for building character classification systems
   - Can be used in text processing pipelines requiring decomposition awareness

4. **Validation:**
   - Consider adding validation functions to verify character ranges
   - Implement helper functions for common decomposition type queries
