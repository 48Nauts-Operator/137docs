# Unicode East Asian Width Properties Documentation

## Overview

This Python file contains Unicode properties data for East Asian Width classification based on Unicode version 13.0.0. The file is auto-generated and provides character ranges for different East Asian Width categories, which are essential for text layout, formatting, and display in multilingual applications.

## Purpose

The East Asian Width property is used to determine the display width of characters in East Asian typography contexts. This is crucial for:

- **Text alignment and formatting** in CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) applications
- **Terminal and console applications** that need to calculate character widths
- **Font rendering systems** that handle mixed East Asian and Latin scripts
- **Text editors and IDEs** for proper cursor positioning and text selection

## Data Structures

### `unicode_east_asian_width`

A dictionary containing Unicode character ranges for each East Asian Width category.

```python
unicode_east_asian_width: dict[str, str]
```

**Categories:**

| Key | Category | Description |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| `"n"` | Neutral | Characters that are context-dependent for width |
| `"na"` | Narrow | Characters that are always narrow (single-width) |
| `"w"` | Wide | Characters that are always wide (double-width) |
| `"f"` | Fullwidth | Full-width characters (typically CJK punctuation) |
| `"h"` | Halfwidth | Half-width characters (typically Katakana) |
| `"a"` | Ambiguous | Characters whose width depends on context |

**Negated Categories:**
- Keys prefixed with `"^"` (e.g., `"^n"`, `"^w"`) contain ranges of characters that do **NOT** belong to that category.

### `ascii_east_asian_width`

A simplified dictionary containing only ASCII character ranges for East Asian Width categories.

```python
ascii_east_asian_width: dict[str, str]
```

This provides a lightweight alternative when only ASCII character handling is needed.

## Character Range Format

Character ranges are stored as compact Unicode range strings:
- Individual characters: `\u1234`
- Ranges: `\u1234-\u5678`  
- Multiple ranges: `\u1234-\u5678\u9abc-\udef0`

## Usage Examples

```python
# Check if a character is wide
def is_wide_character(char):
    code_point = ord(char)
    # Convert to Unicode escape format and check against ranges
    # (Implementation would require range parsing logic)
    pass

# Determine display width of a string
def display_width(text):
    width = 0
    for char in text:
        if is_in_range(char, unicode_east_asian_width['w']):
            width += 2  # Wide characters take 2 columns
        elif is_in_range(char, unicode_east_asian_width['f']):
            width += 2  # Fullwidth characters take 2 columns
        else:
            width += 1  # Most other characters take 1 column
    return width
```

## Important Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Implementation Requirements

- **Range parsing required**: The character range strings need to be parsed to check if a character falls within the specified ranges
- **Unicode escapes**: The strings contain Unicode escape sequences that need proper interpretation
- **Performance considerations**: For high-performance applications, consider pre-processing these ranges into more efficient data structures

### üìù Character Categories

- **Wide (w)** and **Fullwidth (f)** characters typically occupy 2 character cells in fixed-width displays
- **Narrow (na)** and **Halfwidth (h)** characters occupy 1 character cell
- **Ambiguous (a)** characters require context-dependent width determination
- **Neutral (n)** characters are typically 1 character cell but may vary by implementation

### üîÑ Version Information

- Based on **Unicode 13.0.0**
