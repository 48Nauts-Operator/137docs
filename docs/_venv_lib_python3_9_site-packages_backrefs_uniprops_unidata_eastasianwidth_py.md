# Unicode East Asian Width Properties

## Overview

This Python module provides Unicode East Asian Width character properties data from Unicode version 13.0.0. The module contains auto-generated mappings that classify Unicode characters according to their display width properties in East Asian typography contexts.

## Purpose

The East Asian Width property is used to determine the display width of characters when rendering text in East Asian writing systems (Chinese, Japanese, Korean). This is crucial for:

- Text layout and alignment in CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) applications
- Terminal emulators and console applications
- Monospace font rendering
- Text wrapping and line breaking algorithms

## Data Structures

### `unicode_east_asian_width`

A dictionary mapping East Asian Width property codes to Unicode character ranges.

```python
unicode_east_asian_width: dict[str, str]
```

**Keys (Width Categories):**

| Key | Category | Description |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| `"a"` | Ambiguous | Characters that can be narrow or wide depending on context |
| `"f"` | Fullwidth | Characters that take up two character cells |
| `"h"` | Halfwidth | Characters that take up half a character cell |
| `"n"` | Neutral | Characters not specifically East Asian |
| `"na"` | Narrow | Characters that take up one character cell |
| `"w"` | Wide | Characters that take up two character cells |
| `"^a"`, `"^f"`, `"^h"`, `"^n"`, `"^na"`, `"^w"` | Negated sets | Characters NOT in the respective categories |

**Values:** Unicode character ranges as compressed strings using ranges (e.g., `"\x00-\xa0"` represents characters from U+0000 to U+00A0).

### `ascii_east_asian_width`

A simplified dictionary containing East Asian Width properties for ASCII characters only.

```python
ascii_east_asian_width: dict[str, str]
```

This provides a subset focused on ASCII characters (U+0000 to U+007F), which is useful for performance-critical applications that primarily handle ASCII text.

## Usage Examples

```python
# Check if a character is wide
def is_wide_character(char):
    code_point = ord(char)
    # Implementation would check against the 'w' category ranges
    return char in unicode_east_asian_width['w']

# Check if a character is ambiguous width
def is_ambiguous_character(char):
    return char in unicode_east_asian_width['a']
```

## Character Width Categories

### Wide (w) and Fullwidth (f)
- **Width:** 2 cells
- **Examples:** CJK ideographs (漢字), fullwidth Latin characters (Ａ), emojis
- **Use case:** These characters typically occupy the space of two monospace ASCII characters

### Narrow (na) and Halfwidth (h)
- **Width:** 1 cell
- **Examples:** ASCII characters (A-Z, 0-9), halfwidth katakana
- **Use case:** Standard single-width characters

### Neutral (n)
- **Width:** 1 cell
- **Examples:** Most European scripts, symbols
- **Use case:** Characters not specifically designed for East Asian typography

### Ambiguous (a)
- **Width:** Context-dependent (1 or 2 cells)
- **Examples:** Some symbols, Greek letters, mathematical operators
- **Use case:** Width depends on the context (East Asian vs. non-East Asian)

## Implementation Notes

### Performance Considerations
- Use `ascii_east_asian_width` for ASCII-only text processing for better performance
- The character ranges are stored as compressed strings to reduce memory usage
- Consider caching character width lookups for frequently processed characters

### Unicode Version
- Based on **Unicode 13.0.0**
- Auto-generated data ensures accuracy with the Unicode standard
- May need updates when supporting newer Unicode versions

### Integration Suggestions
```python
# Example integration for text width calculation
def calculate_display_width(text, ambiguous_width=1):
    """Calculate display width of text considering East Asian width properties."""
    width = 0
    for char in text:
        if char in unicode_east_asian_width['w'] or char in unicode_east_asian_width['f']:
            width += 2
        elif char in unicode_east_asian_width['a']:
            width += ambiguous_width  # configurable
        else:
            width += 1
    return width
```

## Dependencies

- **Python 3.9+** (uses `dict[str, str]` type annotations)
- **No external dependencies** - pure Python data

## Notes

- This is auto-generated data - do not manually edit
- The `^` prefix indicates negated character sets (characters NOT in that category)
- Character ranges use Unicode escape sequences for compact representation
- Consider the context when handling ambiguous-width characters in your application
