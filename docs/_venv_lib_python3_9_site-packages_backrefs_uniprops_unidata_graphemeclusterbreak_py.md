# Unicode Properties Module

This Python module provides Unicode grapheme cluster break properties based on Unicode version 13.0.0. It contains pre-computed character sets used for grapheme cluster boundary detection in text processing.

## Purpose

The module defines Unicode character ranges for different grapheme cluster break properties, which are essential for:
- Text segmentation and boundary detection
- Proper text rendering and display
- Internationalization and localization
- Text editing operations (cursor movement, selection, etc.)

## Data Structures

### `unicode_grapheme_cluster_break`

A dictionary mapping grapheme cluster break property names to their corresponding Unicode character ranges.

```python
unicode_grapheme_cluster_break: dict[str, str]
```

**Key Properties:**
- **Control characters** (`control`): Format characters, line/paragraph separators
- **Line breaks** (`cr`, `lf`): Carriage return and line feed characters
- **Korean Hangul** (`l`, `v`, `t`, `lv`, `lvt`): Different components of Hangul syllables
- **Text modifiers** (`extend`, `spacingmark`): Combining marks and spacing marks
- **Emoji support** (`ebase`, `emodifier`, `zwj`, `regionalindicator`): Emoji base characters, modifiers, and sequences
- **Text preparation** (`prepend`): Characters that prepend to grapheme clusters

### `ascii_grapheme_cluster_break`

A simplified version containing only ASCII-relevant grapheme cluster break properties.

```python
ascii_grapheme_cluster_break: dict[str, str]
```

This provides a subset focused on ASCII characters, which is more efficient for ASCII-only text processing.

## Character Range Format

Character ranges are represented as Unicode escape sequences:
- Single characters: `\x0a` (newline)
- Ranges: `\x20-\x5c` (space to backslash)
- Unicode codepoints: `\u0300-\u036f` (combining diacritical marks)
- Extended Unicode: `\U0001f1e6-\U0001f1ff` (regional indicator symbols)

## Key Properties Explained

### Line Breaking
- `cr`: Carriage return (`\r`)
- `lf`: Line feed (`\n`)
- `control`: Various control characters including tabs, form feeds

### Korean Hangul Support
- `l`: Leading consonants (초성)
- `v`: Vowels (중성)  
- `t`: Trailing consonants (종성)
- `lv`: Precomposed syllables without trailing consonant
- `lvt`: Fully precomposed syllables

### Text Modification
- `extend`: Combining marks that extend base characters
- `spacingmark`: Spacing combining marks
- `prepend`: Characters that attach to following grapheme clusters

### Emoji and Symbols
- `regionalindicator`: Flag emoji components
- `zwj`: Zero-width joiner for emoji sequences
- `ebase`, `emodifier`: Emoji base characters and modifiers

## Usage Notes

⚠️ **Important Considerations:**

1. **Auto-generated**: This file is automatically generated and should not be manually edited
2. **Unicode Version**: Based on Unicode 13.0.0 - may need updates for newer Unicode versions
3. **Performance**: Use `ascii_grapheme_cluster_break` for ASCII-only text processing for better performance
4. **Negation**: Properties prefixed with `^` represent the complement (negation) of that property

## Example Usage

```python
# Check if a character is a line feed
char = '\n'
if char in unicode_grapheme_cluster_break['lf']:
    print("Character is a line feed")

# Check if character is NOT a control character
if char in unicode_grapheme_cluster_break['^control']:
    print("Character is not a control character")
```

## Integration

This module is typically used by:
- Text processing libraries
- Unicode-aware string manipulation functions
- Grapheme cluster boundary detection algorithms
- Text rendering engines
- Internationalization frameworks

The data in this module serves as the foundation for implementing proper Unicode text segmentation according to the Unicode Standard Annex #29 (Text Segmentation).
