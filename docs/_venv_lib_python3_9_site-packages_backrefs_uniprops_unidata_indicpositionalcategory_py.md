# Unicode Indic Positional Category Properties

This Python module provides Unicode character classification data for Indic Positional Category properties from Unicode version 13.0.0. It contains auto-generated mappings that categorize Unicode characters based on their positional behavior in Indic scripts.

## Purpose

This module is designed to support text processing applications that need to understand how characters are positioned relative to each other in Indic writing systems. The Indic Positional Category property is crucial for:

- Text rendering engines
- Font shaping systems
- Text layout algorithms
- Language processing tools for Indic scripts

## Data Structures

### `unicode_indic_positional_category`

A dictionary mapping positional category names to Unicode character ranges.

```python
unicode_indic_positional_category: dict[str, str]
```

**Categories include:**
- `bottom` - Characters positioned below the base
- `top` - Characters positioned above the base
- `left` - Characters positioned to the left of the base
- `right` - Characters positioned to the right of the base
- `overstruck` - Characters that overlay the base
- `na` - Characters with no specific positional category
- `visualorderleft` - Characters with visual order from left

**Combination categories:**
- `topandbottom` - Characters that span both top and bottom positions
- `leftandright` - Characters that span both left and right positions
- `topandleft` - Characters positioned at top-left
- `topandright` - Characters positioned at top-right
- `bottomandleft` - Characters positioned at bottom-left
- `bottomandright` - Characters positioned at bottom-right
- `topandleftandright` - Characters spanning top, left, and right
- `topandbottomandleft` - Characters spanning top, bottom, and left
- `topandbottomandright` - Characters spanning top, bottom, and right

**Negated categories:**
Categories prefixed with `^` represent the complement (all characters NOT in that category).

### `ascii_indic_positional_category`

A simplified dictionary for ASCII-only character processing.

```python
ascii_indic_positional_category: dict[str, str]
```

Most categories are empty for ASCII, with only `na` containing the full ASCII range, indicating that ASCII characters don't have Indic positional properties.

## Character Range Format

Character ranges are encoded as Unicode escape sequences:
- `\x00-\u093b` - Range from character 0x00 to U+093B
- `\u0941-\u0944` - Range from U+0941 to U+0944
- Individual characters like `\u094d`

## Usage Example

```python
from unicode_properties import unicode_indic_positional_category

# Check if a character is in the 'bottom' category
bottom_chars = unicode_indic_positional_category['bottom']

# Check characters that are NOT in bottom category
not_bottom_chars = unicode_indic_positional_category['^bottom']
```

## Important Notes

- ⚠️ **Auto-generated**: This file is automatically generated and should not be manually edited
- **Unicode Version**: Based on Unicode 13.0.0 - may not include newer character additions
- **Performance**: Character range strings may need parsing for efficient lookup operations
- **Completeness**: Covers comprehensive Indic positional categories but ASCII has limited applicability

## Suggestions for Use

1. **Parse ranges**: Consider converting string ranges to more efficient data structures for frequent lookups
2. **Caching**: Cache parsed results if performing many character classifications
3. **Validation**: Validate Unicode version compatibility with your application requirements
4. **Error handling**: Handle cases where characters might not be covered by this Unicode version
