# Unicode Joining Groups Documentation

## Overview

This Python file contains auto-generated Unicode property data for **Unicode version 13.0.0**, specifically focusing on **joining groups**. It defines character ranges for different joining behaviors used in complex text rendering, particularly for Arabic, Syriac, Malayalam, Manichaean, and other scripts that require contextual character shaping.

## Purpose

The file provides lookup tables for determining how Unicode characters join with adjacent characters in scripts that use contextual forms. This is essential for:

- **Text rendering engines** that need to apply proper character shaping
- **Font engines** that select appropriate glyph variants
- **Text processing libraries** that handle bidirectional and contextual text
- **Regular expression engines** that need to match characters by joining behavior

## Data Structures

### `unicode_joining_group`

A dictionary mapping joining group names to their corresponding Unicode character ranges.

```python
unicode_joining_group: dict[str, str]
```

**Key Features:**
- **Positive groups** (e.g., `"ain"`, `"beh"`, `"lam"`): Define characters that belong to specific joining groups
- **Negative groups** (prefixed with `^`, e.g., `"^ain"`, `"^beh"`): Define characters that do NOT belong to those groups
- **Character ranges** are expressed as Unicode range strings (e.g., `"\u0639-\u063a"`)

### `ascii_joining_group`

A simplified dictionary for ASCII-only contexts.

```python
ascii_joining_group: dict[str, str]
```

**Key Features:**
- **Negative groups**: Map to the full Unicode range `"\x00-\U0010ffff"` (since no ASCII characters belong to these groups)
- **Positive groups**: Map to empty strings `""` (since ASCII characters don't have joining behavior)
- **Exception**: `"nonjoining"` maps to the full range, indicating ASCII characters don't join

## Important Joining Groups

### Arabic Script Groups
- **`alef`**: Alef and its variants - right-joining characters
- **`beh`**: Beh family - dual-joining characters  
- **`heh`**: Heh and related characters
- **`lam`**: Lam family - important for lam-alef ligatures
- **`meem`**: Meem and variants
- **`noon`**: Noon family characters

### Syriac Script Groups
- **`alaph`**: Syriac Alaph
- **`beth`**: Syriac Beth family
- **`gamal`**: Syriac Gamal
- **`he`**: Syriac He

### Malayalam Script Groups
- **`malayalamnga`**: Malayalam Nga
- **`malayalamja`**: Malayalam Ja
- **`malayalambha`**: Malayalam Bha
- (Additional Malayalam consonant groups)

### Manichaean Script Groups
- **`manichaeanaleph`**: Manichaean Aleph
- **`manichaeanbeth`**: Manichaean Beth
- **`manichaeangimel`**: Manichaean Gimel
- (Additional Manichaean letter groups)

### Special Groups
- **`nonjoining`**: Characters that never join with adjacent characters
- **`hanifirohingyapa`**: Hanifi Rohingya Pa variants
- **`rohingyayeh`**: Rohingya Yeh

## Usage Examples

```python
# Check if a character belongs to the 'beh' joining group
from unicode_properties import unicode_joining_group

# Get characters in the 'beh' group
beh_chars = unicode_joining_group["beh"]  # "\u0628\u062a-\u062b..."

# Get characters NOT in the 'beh' group  
not_beh_chars = unicode_joining_group["^beh"]  # "\x00-\u0627..."

# For ASCII-only processing
from unicode_properties import ascii_joining_group
ascii_beh = ascii_joining_group["beh"]  # "" (empty - no ASCII beh characters)
```

## Technical Notes

### Character Range Format
- **Single characters**: `"\u0628"` 
- **Character ranges**: `"\u0639-\u063a"` (from U+0639 to U+063A)
- **Multiple ranges**: `"\u0628\u062a-\u062b\u066e"` (U+0628, U+062A-U+062B, U+066E)
- **Extended ranges**: `"\x00-\u061f\u0621\u0640..."` (multiple non-contiguous ranges)

### Performance Considerations
- These dictionaries are designed for fast lookup operations
- Consider caching results for frequently accessed character ranges
- The `ascii_joining_group` provides optimized lookup for ASCII-only text processing

### Unicode Version
- Based on **Unicode 13.0.0**
- Auto-generated data - manual modifications will be overwritten
- For newer Unicode versions, regenerate this file from official Unicode data

## Integration Suggestions

1. **Text Rendering**: Use these groups to determine contextual character forms
2. **Regular Expressions**: Build character classes for pattern matching
3. **Font Shaping**: Determine which OpenType features to apply
4. **Text Analysis**: Classify characters by their joining behavior
5. **Validation**: Ensure proper character sequences in complex scripts

## Maintenance Notes

- This file is **auto-generated** - do not edit manually
- Regenerate when updating to newer Unicode versions
- Test thoroughly with complex script text after regeneration
- Consider the impact on existing applications when updating
