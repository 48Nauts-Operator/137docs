# Unicode Properties - Numeric Values

This Python file contains Unicode character mappings for numeric values based on Unicode version 13.0.0. It provides comprehensive dictionaries that map numeric values to their corresponding Unicode characters.

## Purpose

The file serves as a lookup table for Unicode characters that represent numeric values, supporting various number systems, scripts, and mathematical notations from around the world. This is useful for:

- Text processing and analysis
- International number system support
- Unicode-aware numeric character validation
- Character classification in text parsing

## Main Data Structures

### `unicode_numeric_values`

A comprehensive dictionary mapping numeric values (as strings) to their Unicode character representations.

```python
unicode_numeric_values: dict[str, str]
```

**Key Features:**
- **Basic digits (0-9)**: Maps to characters from multiple scripts (Latin, Arabic, Devanagari, etc.)
- **Fractions**: Supports various fractional values like "1/2", "3/4", "1/10", etc.
- **Large numbers**: Includes mappings for 10, 100, 1000, up to trillions
- **Negative patterns**: Keys starting with `^` represent negation (characters NOT having that numeric value)
- **Special values**: Includes "nan" for non-numeric characters

**Example entries:**
```python
"0": "\x30\u0660\u06f0..."  # ASCII '0', Arabic-Indic '٠', etc.
"1/2": "\xbd\u0b73..."     # ½, and other half symbols
"100": "\u0bf1\u0d71..."   # Various representations of 100
"^0": "\x00-\x2f\x31-..."  # All characters except those with numeric value 0
```

### `ascii_numeric_values`

A simplified dictionary containing only ASCII numeric characters.

```python
ascii_numeric_values: dict[str, str]
```

**Key Features:**
- Contains only basic ASCII digits 0-9
- Most fractional and large number entries are empty strings
- Negation patterns cover the full Unicode range
- Useful for ASCII-only processing

**Example entries:**
```python
"0": "\x30"                    # ASCII '0'
"1": "\x31"                    # ASCII '1'
"1/2": ""                      # No ASCII representation
"^0": "\x00-\x2f\x31-\U0010ffff"  # All characters except ASCII '0'
```

## Character Range Notation

Both dictionaries use compact range notation for efficiency:

- `\x30-\x39`: Characters from '0' to '9'
- `\u0660-\u0669`: Arabic-Indic digits
- `\U00010107`: Extended Unicode characters
- Individual characters are concatenated without separators

## Usage Examples

```python
# Check if a character represents the digit '5'
if char in unicode_numeric_values["5"]:
    print("Character represents 5")

# Get all characters that are NOT numeric
non_numeric_chars = unicode_numeric_values["nan"]

# ASCII-only digit validation
if char in ascii_numeric_values["1"]:
    print("ASCII digit 1")
```

## Important Notes

- **Auto-generated**: This file is automatically generated from Unicode data
- **Unicode 13.0.0**: Based on Unicode version 13.0.0 specification
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Includes characters from numerous writing systems and mathematical contexts
- **Memory efficient**: Uses range notation to minimize file size
- **Type hints**: Includes proper type annotations for better IDE support

## Suggestions for Use

1. **Text Processing**: Use for international text parsing and numeric character detection
2. **Validation**: Implement Unicode-aware numeric validation functions
3. **Conversion**: Build number system conversion utilities
4. **Analysis**: Perform statistical analysis on numeric content in multilingual text

## Performance Considerations

- The Unicode dictionary is quite large due to comprehensive coverage
- Consider using `ascii_numeric_values` for ASCII-only applications
- Range notation provides memory efficiency but requires proper parsing
- Cache lookups if performing frequent character classification
