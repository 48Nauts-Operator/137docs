# Unicode Properties Documentation

This Python file contains auto-generated Unicode property data for Unicode version 13.0.0. It provides quick check tables for various Unicode normalization forms, used to optimize Unicode text normalization processes.

## Overview

The file defines several dictionaries containing character range patterns used for quick checks during Unicode normalization. These tables help determine whether a string needs normalization or is already in the desired normal form.

## Purpose

- **Unicode Normalization**: Provides quick check data for NFC, NFD, NFKC, and NFKD normalization forms
- **Performance Optimization**: Enables fast pre-checks to avoid unnecessary normalization operations
- **Standards Compliance**: Based on Unicode 13.0.0 specification

## Data Structures

### Unicode Quick Check Tables

The file contains four main sets of quick check dictionaries:

#### 1. NFC (Normalized Form Canonical Composition)
```python
unicode_nfc_quick_check: dict[str, str]
```

#### 2. NFD (Normalized Form Canonical Decomposition)
```python
unicode_nfd_quick_check: dict[str, str]
```

#### 3. NFKC (Normalized Form Compatibility Composition)
```python
unicode_nfkc_quick_check: dict[str, str]
```

#### 4. NFKD (Normalized Form Compatibility Decomposition)
```python
unicode_nfkd_quick_check: dict[str, str]
```

### ASCII Quick Check Tables

For ASCII-only optimization, the file also provides:

- `ascii_nfc_quick_check`
- `ascii_nfd_quick_check`
- `ascii_nfkc_quick_check`
- `ascii_nfkd_quick_check`

## Dictionary Keys

Each quick check dictionary contains the following keys:

- **`"^m"`**: Characters that are NOT "Maybe" (complement of Maybe)
- **`"^n"`**: Characters that are NOT "No" (complement of No)
- **`"^y"`**: Characters that are NOT "Yes" (complement of Yes)
- **`"m"`**: Characters that are "Maybe"
- **`"n"`**: Characters that are "No"
- **`"y"`**: Characters that are "Yes"

## Character Range Format

The values are Unicode character range strings using the format:
- Single characters: `\u0300`
- Character ranges: `\u0300-\u036f`
- Multiple ranges: `\u0300-\u036f\u1ab0-\u1aff`
- Extended Unicode: `\U00011000-\U0001107f`

## Usage Notes

### Important Considerations

- **Auto-generated**: This file is automatically generated and should not be manually edited
- **Version-specific**: Data is specific to Unicode 13.0.0
- **Performance**: These tables enable O(1) quick checks for normalization requirements
- **Completeness**: Covers the full Unicode range including supplementary planes

### Quick Check Logic

The quick check values determine:
- **"Yes"**: String is already in the target normalization form
- **"No"**: String definitely needs normalization
- **"Maybe"**: Further analysis required to determine if normalization is needed

### Example Usage Pattern

```python
# Typical usage in a normalization library
def needs_nfc_normalization(text: str) -> bool:
    # Check if any character is in the "No" category
    for char in text:
        if char in unicode_nfc_quick_check["n"]:
            return True
    return False
```

## Technical Details

- **Import**: Uses `from __future__ import annotations` for forward compatibility
- **Type Hints**: All dictionaries are properly typed as `dict[str, str]`
- **Memory Efficient**: Uses string-based character sets rather than individual character lists
- **Unicode Compliant**: Follows Unicode Consortium specifications for normalization
