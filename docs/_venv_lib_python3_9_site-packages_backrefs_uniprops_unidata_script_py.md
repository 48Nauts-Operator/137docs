# Unicode Properties Module Documentation

## Overview

This module provides Unicode script properties for Unicode version 13.0.0. It contains auto-generated data structures that define character ranges for different Unicode scripts and their ASCII counterparts.

## Purpose

The module serves as a reference for Unicode script classification, allowing applications to:
- Identify which script a character belongs to
- Validate text against specific script requirements
- Filter or process text based on script properties
- Implement internationalization features

## Data Structures

### `unicode_scripts: dict[str, str]`

A dictionary mapping script names to their Unicode character ranges.

**Key Features:**
- **Negated scripts**: Keys starting with `^` represent the inverse of that script (all characters NOT in that script)
- **Positive scripts**: Keys without `^` represent characters belonging to that script
- **Range format**: Values are strings containing Unicode character ranges in a compact format

**Example entries:**
```python
"latin": "\x41-\x5a\x61-\x7a\xaa\xba\xc0-\xd6..."  # Latin script characters
"^latin": "\x00-\x40\x5c\x5b-\x60\x7b-\xa9..."    # Non-Latin characters
```

### `ascii_scripts: dict[str, str]`

A simplified version focusing on ASCII character ranges (0x00-0x7F).

**Key Features:**
- **ASCII subset**: Only includes character ranges within the ASCII range
- **Empty strings**: Many scripts have empty values as they don't contain ASCII characters
- **Common script**: Contains basic ASCII punctuation and symbols
- **Latin script**: Contains ASCII letters A-Z and a-z

## Important Scripts

### Common Scripts in ASCII Range

- **`common`**: Basic ASCII symbols, punctuation, and control characters
- **`latin`**: ASCII letters (A-Z, a-z)  
- **`unknown`**: Extended ASCII characters (0x80-0xFF)

### Major World Scripts

- **`arabic`**: Arabic script and related characters
- **`han`**: Chinese characters (CJK ideographs)
- **`cyrillic`**: Russian and related Cyrillic scripts
- **`greek`**: Greek alphabet
- **`hebrew`**: Hebrew script
- **`devanagari`**: Hindi and Sanskrit script

## Usage Examples

```python
# Check if a character is in Latin script
def is_latin(char):
    code_point = ord(char)
    # Implementation would check against latin ranges
    
# Find all non-ASCII characters
def has_non_ascii(text):
    # Use ^common or unknown ranges to identify
```

## Technical Notes

### Character Range Format
- Ranges use Unicode escape sequences (`\x`, `\u`, `\U`)
- Individual characters and ranges (e.g., `\x41-\x5a`) are concatenated
- Ranges are inclusive on both ends

### Unicode Version
- Based on Unicode 13.0.0
- Auto-generated data ensures accuracy and completeness
- Regular updates needed for newer Unicode versions

## Suggestions for Use

### Performance Considerations
- **Cache lookups**: For frequent script checking, consider caching results
- **Precompile ranges**: Convert string ranges to more efficient data structures for production use
- **Memory usage**: The full Unicode data is large; consider subsetting for specific needs

### Error Handling
```python
# Always validate script names before lookup
script_name = script_name.lower()
if script_name not in unicode_scripts:
    raise ValueError(f"Unknown script: {script_name}")
```

### Best Practices
- Use ASCII version for performance when only ASCII text is expected
- Consider using negated scripts (`^script`) for exclusion filtering
- Validate input encoding before script classification
- Handle edge cases like mixed scripts in single strings

### Integration Tips
- Combine with `unicodedata` module for comprehensive Unicode handling
- Use with regular expression libraries for pattern matching
- Consider locale-specific requirements for text processing

## Limitations

- **Static data**: Requires updates for new Unicode versions
- **Memory footprint**: Large data structures may impact memory usage
- **Processing overhead**: String-based ranges need parsing for efficient use
- **No validation**: Raw data doesn't validate character encoding

This module provides the foundation for Unicode-aware text processing but may need additional wrapper functions for production applications.
