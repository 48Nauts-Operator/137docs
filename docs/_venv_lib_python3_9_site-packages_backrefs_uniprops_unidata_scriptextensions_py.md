# Unicode Properties Module Documentation

## Overview

This Python module contains Unicode script extension mappings for Unicode version 13.0.0. It provides character range definitions for various writing systems and scripts used throughout the world.

## Purpose

The module serves as a reference for Unicode script properties, allowing applications to:
- Identify which writing system(s) a character belongs to
- Filter text by script type
- Validate text input against specific writing systems
- Support internationalization and localization features

## Key Data Structures

### `unicode_script_extensions`

A dictionary mapping script names to Unicode character ranges.

**Type:** `dict[str, str]`

**Key Format:**
- Scripts prefixed with `^` represent **negative character classes** (characters NOT in that script)
- Scripts without `^` represent **positive character classes** (characters in that script)

**Value Format:**
- Strings containing Unicode escape sequences representing character ranges
- Ranges use the format `\uXXXX-\uYYYY` for Basic Multilingual Plane
- Extended ranges use `\UXXXXXXXX-\UYYYYYYYY` for supplementary planes

**Examples:**
```python
# Characters that ARE in the Latin script
unicode_script_extensions["latin"]

# Characters that are NOT in the Arabic script  
unicode_script_extensions["^arabic"]
```

### `ascii_script_extensions`

A simplified version focusing on ASCII character ranges.

**Type:** `dict[str, str]`

**Purpose:** Provides ASCII-only mappings for performance optimization when working with ASCII text.

## Important Scripts

### Major Writing Systems

- **`latin`** - Latin alphabet (A-Z, a-z, extended Latin)
- **`arabic`** - Arabic script and related characters
- **`han`** - Chinese characters (CJK ideographs)
- **`hiragana`** - Japanese hiragana syllabary
- **`katakana`** - Japanese katakana syllabary
- **`hangul`** - Korean Hangul script
- **`cyrillic`** - Cyrillic alphabet
- **`greek`** - Greek alphabet
- **`hebrew`** - Hebrew script

### Special Categories

- **`common`** - Characters shared across scripts (punctuation, numbers, symbols)
- **`inherited`** - Characters that inherit script properties from surrounding text
- **`unknown`** - Unassigned or private use characters

## Usage Examples

```python
from unicode_properties import unicode_script_extensions

# Check if a character is in Latin script
latin_chars = unicode_script_extensions["latin"]

# Get characters NOT in Arabic script
non_arabic = unicode_script_extensions["^arabic"]

# ASCII-only Latin characters
from unicode_properties import ascii_script_extensions
ascii_latin = ascii_script_extensions["latin"]  # "A-Za-z"
```

## Notes and Considerations

### Performance
- Use `ascii_script_extensions` for ASCII-only text processing
- Full Unicode ranges in `unicode_script_extensions` cover all Unicode planes

### Character Ranges
- Ranges are represented as escape sequences, not actual character objects
- Some scripts have complex, non-contiguous ranges
- Negative ranges (`^script`) can be very large

### Unicode Version
- Based on Unicode 13.0.0
- May not include characters added in later Unicode versions
- Consider updating for newer Unicode standards

### Script Extensions vs. Script Property
- This module uses **Script Extensions**, which is more comprehensive than basic Script property
- Characters may belong to multiple scripts (e.g., punctuation used in multiple writing systems)

## Suggestions for Use

1. **Text Analysis**: Use for detecting the primary writing system of text
2. **Input Validation**: Restrict input to specific scripts
3. **Font Selection**: Choose appropriate fonts based on script requirements
4. **Regex Patterns**: Build character classes for regular expressions
5. **Internationalization**: Support multiple writing systems in applications

## Limitations

- Auto-generated data may need manual verification for specific use cases
- Complex scripts may have rendering requirements beyond character classification
- Some modern emoji and symbols may not be properly categorized
- Private Use Area characters are marked as "unknown"

## Related Standards

- Unicode Standard 13.0.0
- UAX #24: Unicode Script Property
- UAX #44: Unicode Character Database
