# Unicode Vertical Orientation Properties

## Overview

This Python module provides Unicode character property data for vertical text orientation, specifically from Unicode version 13.0.0. The file is auto-generated and contains mappings that define how different Unicode characters should be oriented when displayed in vertical writing systems (such as traditional Chinese, Japanese, or Korean vertical text).

## Purpose

The module is designed to support text rendering engines and applications that need to properly display text in vertical writing modes. It helps determine whether characters should be:
- Rotated when displayed vertically
- Kept upright 
- Transformed in other ways

This is particularly important for East Asian languages and mixed-script documents that may contain both horizontal and vertical text elements.

## Data Structures

### `unicode_vertical_orientation`

```python
unicode_vertical_orientation: dict[str, str]
```

**Description**: A dictionary mapping orientation type keys to Unicode character ranges (as compressed strings).

**Keys and their meanings**:
- `"^r"` - Characters that should **not** be rotated (negated "r")
- `"^tr"` - Characters that should **not** be transformed and rotated (negated "tr") 
- `"^tu"` - Characters that should **not** be transformed and upright (negated "tu")
- `"^u"` - Characters that should **not** remain upright (negated "u")
- `"r"` - Characters that should be **rotated** 90 degrees clockwise
- `"tr"` - Characters that should be **transformed and rotated**
- `"tu"` - Characters that should be **transformed and upright**
- `"u"` - Characters that should remain **upright** (not rotated)

### `ascii_vertical_orientation`

```python
ascii_vertical_orientation: dict[str, str]
```

**Description**: A simplified version focusing on ASCII character ranges. Most entries are either empty strings or cover the full Unicode range (`"\x00-\U0010ffff"`).

## Character Range Format

The character ranges in the values are stored as compressed Unicode strings where:
- Individual characters represent single code points
- Ranges like `\u1100-\u11ff` represent continuous character blocks
- Multiple ranges are concatenated together

## Usage Notes

⚠️ **Important Considerations**:

1. **Auto-generated File**: This file is automatically generated - do not edit manually as changes will be overwritten
2. **Unicode Version**: Specifically targets Unicode 13.0.0 - may need updates for newer Unicode versions
3. **Performance**: The character ranges are stored as strings which may require parsing for efficient lookup operations
4. **Memory Usage**: Contains extensive Unicode ranges which may consume significant memory

## Implementation Suggestions

For applications using this data:

```python
# Example: Check if a character should remain upright
def should_remain_upright(char):
    return char in unicode_vertical_orientation["u"]

# Note: Actual implementation would need efficient string range parsing
```
