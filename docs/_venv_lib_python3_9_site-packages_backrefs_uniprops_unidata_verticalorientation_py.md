# Unicode Vertical Orientation Properties

## Overview

This Python file contains Unicode character property data for vertical text orientation, based on Unicode version 13.0.0. The file is auto-generated and provides mappings of Unicode characters to their vertical orientation behaviors.

## Purpose

The file defines how different Unicode characters should be oriented when text is displayed vertically (such as in traditional East Asian writing systems). This is essential for proper text rendering in vertical writing modes used in languages like Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.

## Data Structures

### `unicode_vertical_orientation`

A dictionary mapping orientation type keys to Unicode character ranges represented as strings.

**Keys and their meanings:**
- `^r` - Characters that are **rotated** when text flows vertically
- `^tr` - Characters that are **transformed rotated** when text flows vertically  
- `^tu` - Characters that are **transformed upright** when text flows vertically
- `^u` - Characters that remain **upright** when text flows vertically
- `r` - Characters with **rotated** orientation (base property)
- `tr` - Characters with **transformed rotated** orientation (base property)
- `tu` - Characters with **transformed upright** orientation (base property)  
- `u` - Characters with **upright** orientation (base property)

**Character range format:**
- Individual characters: `\u2016` 
- Character ranges: `\u1100-\u11ff`
- Multiple ranges combined in single strings

### `ascii_vertical_orientation`

A simplified version focusing on ASCII character ranges, with most categories covering the full Unicode range (`\x00-\U0010ffff`) and others being empty strings.

## Key Character Categories

### Upright Characters (`u` key)
- **East Asian characters**: Hangul (`\u1100-\u11ff`), CJK ideographs (`\u4e00-\u9fff` ranges)
- **Symbols**: Mathematical operators, geometric shapes, emoji
- **Punctuation**: East Asian punctuation marks

### Rotated Characters (`r` key)  
- **Latin text**: Basic Latin letters and most Western punctuation
- **Numbers**: Arabic numerals
- **Symbols**: Most mathematical and technical symbols

### Transformed Categories (`tr`, `tu`)
- **Small Japanese characters**: Small kana like っ, ゃ, ゅ, ょ
- **Punctuation**: Specific punctuation marks that need special handling

## Usage Notes

### Important Considerations

- **Auto-generated**: This file is automatically generated - manual edits may be overwritten
- **Unicode 13.0.0**: Based on a specific Unicode version; newer characters may not be included
- **Character ranges**: Uses compact string representation of Unicode ranges rather than individual character lists

### Performance Implications

- Large string concatenations may impact memory usage
- Consider converting to more efficient data structures (sets, ranges) for frequent lookups
- The `^` prefixed keys appear to be variants or overrides of the base properties

### Implementation Suggestions

```python
# Example: Convert to character sets for faster lookup
def parse_unicode_ranges(range_string):
    """Convert Unicode range string to set of characters"""
    # Implementation would parse ranges like "\u1100-\u11ff"
    pass

# Example: Check character orientation
def get_character_orientation(char):
    """Determine vertical orientation for a character"""
    for orientation, ranges in unicode_vertical_orientation.items():
        if char in ranges:  # This would need proper range checking
            return orientation
    return 'u'  # Default to upright
```
