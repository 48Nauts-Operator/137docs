# WinTerm Test Documentation

## Overview

This file contains unit tests for the `WinTerm` class, which is part of the Colorama library. The `WinTerm` class provides Windows-specific terminal color and styling functionality by interfacing with the Windows console API.

## Purpose

The test suite validates the functionality of the `WinTerm` class, ensuring that:
- Terminal attributes (foreground color, background color, and style) are properly initialized
- Color and style attributes can be correctly calculated and applied
- Console output can be properly configured for both stdout and stderr
- Reset functionality works as expected

## Test Class

### `WinTermTest`

Main test class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase` and contains all test methods for the `WinTerm` functionality.

## Test Methods

### `testInit()`
- **Purpose**: Tests the initialization of a `WinTerm` instance
- **Key Features**:
  - Mocks the Windows API calls using `@patch`
  - Verifies that terminal attributes are correctly parsed from console buffer info
  - Tests the bit manipulation for extracting foreground (7), background (6), and style (8) values

```python
# Example: wAttributes = 7 + 6 * 16 + 8 = 111
# Foreground: 7, Background: 6, Style: 8
```

### `testGetAttrs()`
- **Purpose**: Tests the calculation of combined terminal attributes
- **Platform Requirement**: Windows only (`@skipUnless` decorator)
- **Validates**:
  - Zero attributes return 0
  - Foreground color values
  - Background color calculation (multiplied by 16)
  - Combined foreground, background, and style attributes

### `testResetAll()`
- **Purpose**: Tests the terminal reset functionality
- **Key Features**:
  - Mocks Windows API calls
  - Verifies that terminal attributes are restored to original console values
  - Ensures `set_console()` is called during reset

### `testFore()`, `testBack()`, `testStyle()`
- **Purpose**: Test individual attribute setters
- **Platform Requirement**: Windows only
- **Common Pattern**:
  - Mock the `set_console` method
  - Call the respective setter method
  - Verify the internal attribute is updated
  - Confirm `set_console()` was called

### `testSetConsole()` and `testSetConsoleOnStderr()`
- **Purpose**: Test console attribute application
- **Key Features**:
  - Mock Windows API calls
  - Verify correct Windows API function calls
  - Test both stdout and stderr output targets

## Dependencies

### External Libraries
- `unittest` - Python's built-in testing framework
- `mock` - Mocking library (with fallback for older Python versions)

### Internal Imports
```python
from ..winterm import WinColor, WinStyle, WinTerm
```

## Key Components Tested

### `WinTerm` Class Features
- **Initialization**: Reads current console attributes
- **Attribute Management**: Tracks foreground, background, and style separately
- **Console Control**: Applies attributes to Windows console
- **Reset Functionality**: Restores original console state

### `WinColor` and `WinStyle` Enums
- Used for defining color constants and style flags
- Applied in combination to create terminal formatting

## Notes and Suggestions

### Platform Compatibility
- Many tests use `@skipUnless(sys.platform.startswith("win"))` to ensure Windows-only functionality is only tested on Windows systems
- Consider running these tests in a Windows environment for full coverage

### Mocking Strategy
- Extensive use of mocking for Windows API calls prevents actual console manipulation during testing
- The `@patch('colorama.winterm.win32')` decorator isolates the code from system dependencies

### Test Coverage Considerations
- Tests focus on the public API and critical internal state management
- Error handling and edge cases could benefit from additional test coverage
- Integration tests with actual console output might be valuable for end-to-end validation

### Maintenance Notes
- Mock objects should be kept in sync with actual Windows API behavior
- Consider adding tests for error conditions and invalid input values
- The bit manipulation logic for attribute calculation is critical and well-covered

## Running the Tests

Execute the test file directly:
```bash
python -m unittest winterm_test.py
```

Or run as a script:
```bash
python winterm_test.py
```

**Note**: Full test execution requires a Windows environment for platform-specific tests.
