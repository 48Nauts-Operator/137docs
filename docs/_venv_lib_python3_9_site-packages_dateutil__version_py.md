# Version Configuration File

## Overview

This is an auto-generated version configuration file created by `setuptools_scm`. It contains version information for the Python package and should **not be manually edited or tracked in version control**.

## Purpose

The file serves as a centralized location for version information that can be imported and used throughout the package. It provides both string and tuple representations of the current package version.

## Contents

### Version Variables

The file defines two main version-related variables:

#### `__version__` / `version`
- **Type**: `str`
- **Value**: `'2.9.0.post0'`
- **Description**: String representation of the package version following semantic versioning with a post-release identifier

#### `__version_tuple__` / `version_tuple`
- **Type**: `tuple`
- **Value**: `(2, 9, 0)`
- **Description**: Tuple representation of the version for programmatic comparison and parsing

## Usage Example

```python
# Import version information
from your_package import __version__, __version_tuple__

# Use string version for display
print(f"Package version: {__version__}")

# Use tuple version for comparison
if __version_tuple__ >= (2, 9, 0):
    print("Version requirement met")
```

## Important Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Do Not Modify
- This file is automatically generated by `setuptools_scm`
- Manual changes will be overwritten during the next build
- The content is dynamically created based on git tags and commit history

### üö´ Version Control
- **Do not commit this file** to your version control system
- Add it to your `.gitignore` file
- The file should be regenerated during package installation/build

### üìù Version Format
- The version `2.9.0.post0` indicates:
  - Major version: `2`
  - Minor version: `9`
  - Patch version: `0`
  - Post-release: `post0` (indicates a post-release of version 2.9.0)

## Related Configuration

To ensure this file is properly managed:

1. **Add to `.gitignore`:**
   ```gitignore
   # setuptools_scm generated files
   */_version.py
   */version.py
   ```

2. **Configure setuptools_scm in `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml`:**
   ```python
   # setup.py
   setup(
       use_scm_version=True,
       setup_requires=['setuptools_scm'],
   )
   ```
