# Version Module Documentation

## Overview

This is an auto-generated version module created by `setuptools_scm`, a tool that manages version numbers for Python packages based on version control system tags and commits.

## Purpose

- **Automatic Version Management**: Provides version information for the Python package without manual maintenance
- **Single Source of Truth**: Centralizes version information that can be imported and used throughout the package
- **Build Integration**: Integrates with the package build process to ensure consistent versioning

## Important Variables

### `__version__` and `version`
```python
__version__ = version = '2.9.0.post0'
```
- **Type**: `str`
- **Description**: The complete version string of the package
- **Format**: Follows [PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) versioning standard
- **Current Value**: `'2.9.0.post0'` (indicates a post-release of version 2.9.0)

### `__version_tuple__` and `version_tuple`
```python
__version_tuple__ = version_tuple = (2, 9, 0)
```
- **Type**: `tuple[int, ...]`
- **Description**: Tuple representation of the version for programmatic comparison
- **Current Value**: `(2, 9, 0)` (excludes post-release suffix for clean numeric comparison)

## Usage Examples

```python
# Import version information
from your_package import __version__, __version_tuple__

# Check version string
print(f"Package version: {__version__}")

# Version comparison using tuple
if __version_tuple__ >= (2, 9, 0):
    print("Using compatible version")

# Conditional feature usage based on version
major, minor, patch = __version_tuple__
if major >= 3:
    # Use newer API
    pass
```

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Do Not Modify**: This file is automatically generated and should not be edited manually

⚠️ **Version Control**: Do not track this file in version control (should be in `.gitignore`)

ℹ️ **setuptools_scm**: This file is regenerated each time the package is built or installed

ℹ️ **Version Format**: The `.post0` suffix indicates this is a post-release, typically used for packaging fixes that don't change the actual code

## Integration

This version module is typically:
- Imported by the main package `__init__.py`
- Used by setup scripts and build tools
- Referenced by documentation generators
- Utilized for runtime version checks and compatibility

## Related Tools

- **setuptools_scm**: Manages version generation based on Git/Mercurial tags
- **PEP 440**: Python versioning standard that defines the format used
- **setup.py/pyproject.toml**: Build configuration that integrates with this versioning system
