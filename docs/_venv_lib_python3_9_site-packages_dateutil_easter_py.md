# Easter Calculation Module

## Overview

This module provides a comprehensive method for calculating Easter dates across different calendar systems and traditions. It implements three distinct algorithms to determine Easter Sunday for any given year, supporting Western, Orthodox, and Julian calendar calculations.

## Purpose

The module addresses the complex problem of Easter date calculation, which varies depending on:
- Calendar system (Julian vs Gregorian)
- Religious tradition (Western vs Orthodox Christianity)
- Historical periods and their corresponding calculation methods

## Constants

The module defines three calculation method constants:

```python
EASTER_JULIAN = 1      # Original Julian calendar calculation
EASTER_ORTHODOX = 2    # Julian method converted to Gregorian calendar
EASTER_WESTERN = 3     # Revised Gregorian calendar method (default)
```

## Main Function

### `easter(year, method=EASTER_WESTERN)`

Calculates the Easter date for a given year using the specified method.

#### Parameters
- **year** (`int`): The year for which to calculate Easter (must be appropriate for the chosen method)
- **method** (`int`, optional): The calculation method to use. Defaults to `EASTER_WESTERN`

#### Returns
- **`datetime.date`**: The date of Easter Sunday for the specified year

#### Raises
- **`ValueError`**: If an invalid method (not 1, 2, or 3) is provided

#### Example Usage

```python
import datetime
from easter_module import easter, EASTER_WESTERN, EASTER_ORTHODOX, EASTER_JULIAN

# Calculate Western Easter for 2024
western_easter = easter(2024)  # Uses EASTER_WESTERN by default
print(western_easter)  # 2024-03-31

# Calculate Orthodox Easter for 2024
orthodox_easter = easter(2024, EASTER_ORTHODOX)
print(orthodox_easter)  # 2024-05-05

# Calculate Julian Easter for 2024
julian_easter = easter(2024, EASTER_JULIAN)
print(julian_easter)  # 2024-04-22
```

## Algorithm Details

The implementation is based on established astronomical and mathematical principles:

### Method Validity Ranges
1. **Julian Method** (`EASTER_JULIAN`): Valid for dates after 326 AD
2. **Orthodox Method** (`EASTER_ORTHODOX`): Valid for years 1583 to 4099
3. **Western Method** (`EASTER_WESTERN`): Valid for years 1583 to 4099

### Key Variables
- **g**: Golden year - 1 (position in 19-year Metonic cycle)
- **c**: Century
- **h**: (23 - Epact) mod 30
- **i**: Days from March 21 to Paschal Full Moon
- **j**: Weekday for Paschal Full Moon (0=Sunday)
- **p**: Days from March 21 to Easter Sunday
- **e**: Extra days for Julian to Gregorian conversion

## Important Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Year Range Limitations
- For Orthodox and Western methods, use years between 1583-4099 for accurate results
- Julian method is valid from 326 AD onwards
- No input validation is performed on year ranges

### üîç Algorithm Sources
The implementation is based on work by:
- GM Arts
- Claus Tondering's calendar algorithms
- Ouding (1940) algorithm
- "Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac"

### üìÖ Date Range Results
Easter dates can fall between March 22 and May 23, though May 23 is theoretical and never occurs in practice.

## Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Input Validation**: Add year range validation for each method
2. **Error Handling**: Provide more descriptive error messages
3. **Documentation**: Add type hints for better IDE support
4. **Testing**: Include unit tests with known Easter dates
5. **Performance**: Consider caching results for frequently requested years
