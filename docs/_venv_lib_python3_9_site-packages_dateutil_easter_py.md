# Easter Date Calculation Module

## Overview

This module provides a comprehensive solution for calculating Easter dates across different calendar systems and traditions. It implements three distinct algorithms to compute Easter Sunday for any given year, supporting Western (Gregorian), Orthodox, and Julian calendar calculations.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this module is to accurately determine Easter dates using historically and religiously appropriate calculation methods. Easter date calculation is complex due to its dependency on lunar cycles, solar calendar systems, and different religious traditions that evolved over centuries.

## Constants

The module defines three calculation method constants:

```python
EASTER_JULIAN = 1      # Original Julian calendar calculation
EASTER_ORTHODOX = 2    # Julian method converted to Gregorian calendar
EASTER_WESTERN = 3     # Modern Gregorian calendar calculation (default)
```

## Main Function

### `easter(year, method=EASTER_WESTERN)`

**Purpose:** Calculates the Easter date for a specified year using the chosen calculation method.

**Parameters:**
- `year` (int): The year for which to calculate Easter (valid ranges depend on method)
- `method` (int, optional): Calculation method constant (defaults to `EASTER_WESTERN`)

**Returns:** `datetime.date` object representing Easter Sunday

**Raises:** `ValueError` if an invalid method is provided

## Calculation Methods

### Method 1: Julian Calendar (`EASTER_JULIAN`)
- **Valid for:** Years after 326 AD
- **Use case:** Historical Easter dates in the original Julian calendar system
- **Algorithm:** Original calculation as established in early Christianity

### Method 2: Orthodox (`EASTER_ORTHODOX`) 
- **Valid for:** Years 1583 to 4099
- **Use case:** Orthodox Christian Easter dates
- **Algorithm:** Julian calculation converted to Gregorian calendar dates
- **Note:** Can produce dates significantly later than Western Easter

### Method 3: Western (`EASTER_WESTERN`)
- **Valid for:** Years 1583 to 4099  
- **Use case:** Western Christian Easter dates (Catholic, Protestant)
- **Algorithm:** Revised Gregorian calendar method
- **Note:** This is the default method used by most Western churches

## Usage Examples

```python
import datetime
from easter_module import easter, EASTER_WESTERN, EASTER_ORTHODOX, EASTER_JULIAN

# Calculate Western Easter for 2024
western_easter = easter(2024)
print(f"Western Easter 2024: {western_easter}")

# Calculate Orthodox Easter for 2024
orthodox_easter = easter(2024, EASTER_ORTHODOX)
print(f"Orthodox Easter 2024: {orthodox_easter}")

# Calculate Julian Easter for historical year
julian_easter = easter(1500, EASTER_JULIAN)
print(f"Julian Easter 1500: {julian_easter}")
```

## Algorithm Background

The implementation is based on well-established astronomical and mathematical work:

- **Original Algorithm:** Claus Tondering
- **Historical Basis:** Ouding (1940) algorithm
- **Reference Source:** "Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac"
- **Port Source:** GM Arts implementation

## Important Notes and Limitations

### Year Validity Ranges
- **Julian method:** Valid after 326 AD (Council of Nicaea)
- **Orthodox/Western methods:** Valid 1583-4099 (Gregorian calendar adoption)

### Accuracy Considerations
- Results are mathematically accurate within specified date ranges
- Orthodox Easter can occur up to 5 weeks after Western Easter
- The algorithm accounts for leap years and century adjustments

### Technical Implementation Notes
- All calculations use integer arithmetic for precision
- The algorithm handles the complex lunar cycle calculations internally
- Date conversion between Julian and Gregorian systems is automatically handled

## Suggestions for Use

1. **Default Usage:** Use `EASTER_WESTERN` for most modern applications
2. **Historical Research:** Use `EASTER_JULIAN` for pre-1583 dates
3. **Orthodox Applications:** Use `EASTER_ORTHODOX` for Eastern Christian contexts
4. **Input Validation:** Always validate year ranges based on your chosen method
5. **Error Handling:** Wrap calls in try-catch blocks to handle invalid method parameters
