# tzwin Module Documentation

## Overview

This module serves as a **deprecated compatibility layer** for timezone functionality that has been relocated within the `dateutil` library structure.

## Purpose

The `tzwin` module was originally part of the main `dateutil` package but has been moved to `dateutil.tz.win` for better organization. This file maintains backward compatibility by importing all functionality from the new location.

## Current Implementation

```python
# tzwin has moved to dateutil.tz.win
from .tz.win import *
```

The module performs a wildcard import (`*`) from `dateutil.tz.win`, making all classes, functions, and constants from the new location available through the old import path.

## Migration Notes

### For Library Maintainers
- This is a **compatibility shim** that may be removed in future versions
- The comment indicates this is a temporary measure during a refactoring process

### For End Users
- **Recommended Action**: Update your imports to use the new location
- **Old import** (deprecated):
  ```python
  from dateutil.tzwin import *
  # or
  import dateutil.tzwin
  ```
- **New import** (recommended):
  ```python
  from dateutil.tz.win import *
  # or
  import dateutil.tz.win
  ```

## Important Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Deprecation Warning**
- This compatibility layer may be removed in future versions of `dateutil`
- Code relying on `dateutil.tzwin` should be updated to use `dateutil.tz.win`

üìù **Best Practices**
- Avoid using wildcard imports (`*`) in production code
- Import only the specific classes/functions you need
- Update existing code to use the new module path when possible
