# Python 3.8/3.9 Compatibility Layer

## Overview

This module provides a compatibility layer for Python 3.8 and 3.9, ensuring that certain functionality works consistently across different Python versions. It serves as a bridge to handle differences in the standard library's `importlib.metadata` module and related classes between Python versions.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this module is to:
- Provide backward compatibility for distribution and entry point handling
- Work around missing methods or attributes in older Python versions
- Prevent circular import issues through conditional imports and delayed loading

## Functions

### `normalized_name(dist: Distribution) -> str | None`

Handles name normalization for distribution objects that may not provide the `_normalized_name` attribute.

**Parameters:**
- `dist`: A Distribution object

**Returns:**
- `str | None`: The normalized name of the distribution, or None if not available

**Behavior:**
- First attempts to access the `_normalized_name` attribute directly
- If the attribute doesn't exist (AttributeError), falls back to manual normalization using:
  - The distribution's `name` attribute, or
  - The 'Name' field from the distribution's metadata
- Uses the `Prepared.normalize()` method for consistent name normalization

```python
# Example usage
normalized = normalized_name(some_distribution)
```

### `ep_matches(ep: EntryPoint, **params) -> bool`

Provides a workaround for EntryPoint objects that lack the `matches` method.

**Parameters:**
- `ep`: An EntryPoint object
- `**params`: Keyword arguments to pass to the matches method

**Returns:**
- `bool`: True if the entry point matches the given parameters

**Behavior:**
- First tries to call the native `matches()` method on the EntryPoint
- If the method doesn't exist (AttributeError), reconstructs a compatible EntryPoint object
- Uses the reconstructed object's `matches()` method with the provided parameters

```python
# Example usage
if ep_matches(entry_point, name="some_name", group="console_scripts"):
    # Handle matching entry point
    pass
```

## Type Handling

The module uses conditional type imports to prevent circular dependencies:

- **During type checking**: Imports actual `Distribution` and `EntryPoint` classes
- **At runtime**: Uses `Any` type to avoid circular import issues
- Utilizes `TYPE_CHECKING` flag for safe type annotations

## Notes and Considerations

### Import Strategy
- **Delayed imports**: Critical imports are performed inside functions to prevent circular dependencies
- **Conditional imports**: Type-only imports are separated from runtime imports

### Error Handling
- Both functions use try/except blocks with `AttributeError` to gracefully handle missing methods/attributes
- Fallback mechanisms ensure functionality works across Python versions

### Dependencies
- Relies on parent module components (`Distribution`, `EntryPoint`, `Prepared`)
- Uses `md_none` utility from the typing module
- Designed to work within a larger package structure

## Usage Recommendations

1. **Use these functions instead of direct method calls** when targeting multiple Python versions
2. **Import this module early** in your compatibility layer to ensure consistent behavior
3. **Test thoroughly** across target Python versions to verify compatibility
4. **Monitor for deprecation** of these workarounds as older Python versions become unsupported

## Version Compatibility

This module specifically targets compatibility issues present in:
- Python 3.8
- Python 3.9

It may become unnecessary as support for these versions is eventually dropped from the project.
