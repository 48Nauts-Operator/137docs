# Python 3.8/3.9 Compatibility Layer

## Overview

This module provides a compatibility layer for Python 3.8 and 3.9, ensuring that newer functionality works correctly across different Python versions. It contains workaround functions that handle missing methods or attributes in older Python versions by providing fallback implementations.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this compatibility layer is to:

- Bridge functionality gaps between Python versions
- Handle missing methods in `Distribution` and `EntryPoint` objects
- Prevent circular import issues through conditional imports and delayed imports
- Ensure consistent behavior across different Python environments

## Functions

### `normalized_name(dist: Distribution) -> str | None`

Handles name normalization for distribution objects that may not provide the `_normalized_name` attribute.

**Parameters:**
- `dist`: A `Distribution` object

**Returns:**
- `str | None`: The normalized distribution name, or `None` if unavailable

**Behavior:**
- First attempts to access the `_normalized_name` attribute directly
- If the attribute doesn't exist (raises `AttributeError`), falls back to:
  - Using the `name` attribute if available
  - Extracting the name from `dist.metadata['Name']` as a last resort
  - Normalizes the name using `Prepared.normalize()`

```python
# Example usage
normalized = normalized_name(some_distribution)
```

### `ep_matches(ep: EntryPoint, **params) -> bool`

Provides a workaround for `EntryPoint` objects that lack the `matches` method.

**Parameters:**
- `ep`: An `EntryPoint` object
- `**params`: Keyword arguments to pass to the matching function

**Returns:**
- `bool`: Result of the matching operation

**Behavior:**
- First tries to call the native `matches` method
- If the method doesn't exist (raises `AttributeError`):
  - Reconstructs the `EntryPoint` object using `ep.name`, `ep.value`, and `ep.group`
  - Calls `matches(**params)` on the reconstructed object

```python
# Example usage
is_match = ep_matches(entry_point, name="my_plugin", group="console_scripts")
```

## Type Handling

The module uses conditional type imports to prevent circular dependencies:

```python
if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from .. import Distribution, EntryPoint
else:
    Distribution = EntryPoint = Any
```

This approach ensures that:
- Type checkers can access proper type definitions
- Runtime execution avoids circular import issues
- The code remains compatible across different environments

## Import Strategy

The module employs **delayed imports** to prevent circular dependencies:

- Imports are placed inside functions rather than at module level
- Critical imports like `Prepared` and `EntryPoint` are imported only when needed
- This pattern is indicated by comments like `# -> delay to prevent circular imports`

## Notes and Suggestions

### Best Practices
- This compatibility layer should be used when working with mixed Python environments
- Always test compatibility functions with the target Python versions
- Consider removing this layer when dropping support for Python 3.8/3.9

### Maintenance Considerations
- Monitor when the underlying issues are resolved in newer Python versions
- Update or remove compatibility code as minimum Python version requirements change
- Keep track of which specific Python versions require each workaround

### Usage Warning
- The `pragma: no cover` comment suggests this code may not be fully covered by tests
- Consider adding comprehensive tests for both code paths (with and without compatibility issues)
