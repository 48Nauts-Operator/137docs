# Package Inspector Module

## Overview

This Python module provides functionality to inspect and discover Python packages (distributions) within specified paths. It serves as a diagnostic tool to help developers understand what packages are available in their Python environment.

## Purpose

The module's primary purpose is to:
- Scan directories for installed Python packages
- Display discovered packages in a readable format
- Provide insight into the Python environment's package structure

## Functions

### `inspect(path)`

Inspects a single directory path for Python distributions/packages.

**Parameters:**
- `path` (str): The directory path to inspect for packages

**Behavior:**
- Prints the path being inspected
- Uses `Distribution.discover()` to find packages in the specified path
- If packages are found, displays the count and names of discovered packages
- If no packages are found, silently returns

**Example Output:**
```
Inspecting /usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages
Found 15 packages: requests, numpy, pandas, flask, django
```

### `run()`

Executes the inspection process across all paths in the Python system path.

**Behavior:**
- Iterates through all directories in `sys.path`
- Calls `inspect()` for each path
- Provides a comprehensive overview of all discoverable packages in the Python environment

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- `Distribution` class from the current package (imported via relative import)
  - Requires `Distribution.discover()` method that accepts a `path` parameter

### Standard Library Dependencies
- `sys`: Used to access `sys.path` for system-wide path inspection

## Usage

### As a Script
```bash
python -m package_inspector
```

### As a Module
```python
from package_inspector import inspect, run

# Inspect a specific path
inspect('/path/to/packages')

# Inspect all system paths
run()
```

## Notes and Suggestions

### Current Implementation Notes
- The module assumes the `Distribution` class has a `discover()` class method
- Error handling is minimal - the module may fail silently if paths are inaccessible
- Output is printed directly to stdout

### Potential Improvements

1. **Error Handling**: Add try-catch blocks to handle:
   - Permission errors when accessing directories
   - Import errors if `Distribution` class is unavailable
   - Invalid path errors

2. **Logging**: Consider using the `logging` module instead of `print()` statements for better control over output

3. **Return Values**: Modify functions to return data structures instead of just printing, enabling programmatic use

4. **Filtering Options**: Add parameters to filter packages by name, version, or other criteria

5. **Output Formatting**: Add options for different output formats (JSON, CSV, etc.)

### Example Enhanced Usage
```python
# Suggested improvement
def inspect(path, return_data=False):
    try:
        dists = list(Distribution.discover(path=[path]))
        if return_data:
            return [dist.name for dist in dists]
        # ... existing print logic
    except (PermissionError, FileNotFoundError) as e:
        print(f"Warning: Could not access {path}: {e}")
        return [] if return_data else None
```

## Security Considerations

- The module reads from system paths which should generally be safe
- No file modifications are performed
- Consider path validation if accepting user input for custom paths
