# Package Inspector Module

## Overview

This module provides functionality to inspect and discover Python packages installed in various paths. It serves as a diagnostic tool to identify what packages are available in different locations within the Python path.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this module is to:
- Scan specified directories for installed Python packages
- Display a summary of discovered packages
- Provide a command-line interface for package discovery across the entire Python path

## Functions

### `inspect(path)`

Inspects a single directory path for Python packages.

**Parameters:**
- `path` (str): The directory path to inspect for packages

**Behavior:**
- Prints the path being inspected
- Uses `Distribution.discover()` to find packages in the specified path
- If packages are found, displays the count and names of discovered packages
- Silently returns if no packages are found

**Example Output:**
```
Inspecting /usr/lib/python3.9/site-packages
Found 25 packages: numpy, pandas, requests, flask, django
```

### `run()`

Executes the inspection process across all paths in `sys.path`.

**Behavior:**
- Iterates through each path in Python's `sys.path`
- Calls `inspect()` for each path
- Provides a comprehensive overview of all packages available in the Python environment

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- `Distribution` class from the current package (imported as relative import)

### External Dependencies
- `sys` module (standard library)

## Usage

### As a Module
```python
from package_inspector import inspect, run

# Inspect a specific path
inspect('/path/to/packages')

# Inspect all Python paths
run()
```

### As a Script
```bash
python -m package_inspector
```

## Notes and Suggestions

### Current Limitations
- **Silent failure**: The `inspect()` function doesn't provide feedback when no packages are found in a path
- **Error handling**: No exception handling for invalid paths or permission issues
- **Output formatting**: Limited formatting options for different output needs

### Suggested Improvements

1. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   ```python
   def inspect(path):
       try:
           print("Inspecting", path)
           dists = list(Distribution.discover(path=[path]))
           if not dists:
               print("  No packages found")
               return
           print("Found", len(dists), "packages:", end=' ')
           print(', '.join(dist.name for dist in dists))
       except (OSError, PermissionError) as e:
           print(f"  Error accessing path: {e}")
   ```

2. **Add Verbose Mode**
   - Include package versions
   - Show package metadata
   - Display installation paths

3. **Output Formatting Options**
   - JSON output for programmatic use
   - Tabular format for better readability
   - Filter options for specific packages

4. **Command Line Arguments**
   - Allow specific path inspection
   - Add verbosity controls
   - Include help documentation

### Dependencies Note
Ensure that the `Distribution` class is properly implemented in the parent module and provides the expected `discover()` method with the correct interface.
