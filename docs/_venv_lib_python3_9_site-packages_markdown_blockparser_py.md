# BlockParser Module Documentation

## Overview

The `blockparser` module is part of the Python Markdown library and handles the basic parsing of Markdown blocks. This module focuses on block-level elements (such as paragraphs, lists, quotes, and headers) rather than inline elements like bold or italic text.

## Purpose

- Parse Markdown text into block-level elements
- Convert Markdown blocks into an XML ElementTree structure
- Provide a framework for extensible block processing through `BlockProcessor` components
- Maintain parsing state during nested block processing

## Classes

### State Class

A utility class that tracks the current and nested state of the parser during processing.

#### Key Features:
- Extends Python's built-in `list` class
- Manages nested parsing states using a stack-like approach
- Ensures proper state management for nested block elements

#### Methods:

```python
def set(self, state: Any):
    """ Set a new state by appending to the stack """

def reset(self) -> None:
    """ Remove the most recent state from the stack """

def isstate(self, state: Any) -> bool:
    """ Check if the current (top-level) state matches the given state """
```

#### Usage Example:
```python
state = State()
state.set('list')      # Enter list processing
state.set('quote')     # Enter nested quote within list
state.isstate('quote') # Returns True
state.reset()          # Exit quote, back to list
state.isstate('list')  # Returns True
```

### BlockParser Class

The main parser class that orchestrates the parsing of Markdown blocks into an ElementTree structure.

#### Initialization

```python
def __init__(self, md: Markdown):
```

**Attributes:**
- `blockprocessors`: A registry of `BlockProcessor` objects that handle different block types
- `state`: A `State` object for tracking parsing state
- `md`: Reference to the parent Markdown instance

#### Key Methods

##### parseDocument()

```python
def parseDocument(self, lines: Iterable[str]) -> etree.ElementTree:
```

- **Purpose**: Parse a complete Markdown document
- **Parameters**: 
  - `lines`: An iterable of text lines representing the document
- **Returns**: An `ElementTree` object with parsed content
- **Usage**: Called for parsing entire documents

##### parseChunk()

```python
def parseChunk(self, parent: etree.Element, text: str) -> None:
```

- **Purpose**: Parse a chunk of Markdown text and attach to existing element
- **Parameters**:
  - `parent`: The parent XML element to attach parsed content
  - `text`: The Markdown text to parse
- **Usage**: Typically called by extensions for parsing text fragments

##### parseBlocks()

```python
def parseBlocks(self, parent: etree.Element, blocks: list[str]) -> None:
```

- **Purpose**: Process individual blocks of Markdown text
- **Parameters**:
  - `parent`: The parent XML element
  - `blocks`: List of text blocks (typically split on blank lines)
- **Usage**: Core parsing logic that iterates through registered block processors

## Architecture Notes

### Block Processing Flow

1. **Document Splitting**: Text is split into blocks (typically on double newlines)
2. **Processor Iteration**: Each block is tested against registered `BlockProcessor` objects
3. **First Match Wins**: The first processor that matches a block handles it
4. **Recursive Processing**: Processors can recursively call parsing methods for nested content

### Extension Points

- **Custom Block Processors**: Extensions can add, replace, or remove block processors
- **State Management**: The `State` class allows processors to maintain context during nested parsing
- **Registry System**: The `blockprocessors` registry provides ordered processing of different block types

## Usage Recommendations

### For Extension Developers

- Use `parseChunk()` when you need to parse Markdown content within your custom block processor
- Always properly manage state using `state.set()` and `state.reset()` for nested elements
- Register custom block processors through the `blockprocessors` registry

### Performance Considerations

- The parser processes blocks sequentially, testing each against all processors
- Order of processors in the registry affects performance - place more common block types first
- Avoid creating deeply nested parsing states when possible

## Dependencies

- `xml.etree.ElementTree`: For XML/HTML element tree manipulation
- `markdown.util`: Utility functions and the Registry class
- `markdown.blockprocessors`: Block processor implementations (imported via TYPE_CHECKING)

## Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This module handles only block-level parsing. Inline element processing (bold, italic, links, etc.) is handled separately by inline processors.

üí° **Tip**: When extending this parser, ensure your custom block processors properly handle the `test()` and `run()` methods as expected by the `parseBlocks()` method.
