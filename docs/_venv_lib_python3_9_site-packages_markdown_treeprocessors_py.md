# Python Markdown Tree Processors

This module implements tree processors for the Python Markdown library. Tree processors are components that manipulate the ElementTree structure after block processing but before final HTML serialization.

## Purpose

Tree processors serve as a post-processing stage in the Markdown conversion pipeline. They can:
- Apply inline patterns (links, emphasis, code spans, etc.)
- Format and prettify the HTML output
- Unescape special characters
- Create entirely new ElementTree structures
- Add final adjustments like summaries or collected references

## Key Functions

### `build_treeprocessors(md: Markdown, **kwargs: Any) -> util.Registry[Treeprocessor]`

Builds and registers the default tree processors for Markdown processing.

**Default processors registered:**
- `InlineProcessor` (priority: 20) - Processes inline patterns
- `PrettifyTreeprocessor` (priority: 10) - Adds formatting and line breaks
- `UnescapeTreeprocessor` (priority: 0) - Restores escaped characters

### `isString(s: object) -> bool`

Utility function that returns `True` if the object is a string but not an `AtomicString`. This is used to determine if text should be processed for inline patterns.

## Core Classes

### `Treeprocessor`

Base class for all tree processors.

**Key Method:**
```python
def run(self, root: etree.Element) -> etree.Element | None:
    """
    Process the root Element. Can return a new Element to replace
    the root, or modify the existing tree and return None.
    """
```

### `InlineProcessor`

The most complex tree processor that applies inline patterns (emphasis, links, code spans, etc.) to text content.

**Key Features:**
- Processes placeholders and converts them to proper HTML elements
- Maintains ancestor tracking to prevent nested incompatible elements
- Handles both old and new style inline pattern processors
- Recursively processes text and tail content of elements

**Important Methods:**
- `run(tree, ancestors=None)` - Main processing entry point
- `__handleInline(data, patternIndex=0)` - Processes text with inline patterns
- `__processPlaceholders(data, parent, isText=True)` - Converts placeholders to elements

### `PrettifyTreeprocessor`

Adds proper formatting and line breaks to the HTML output for readability.

**Features:**
- Adds line breaks between block-level elements
- Handles `<br>` tags specially
- Cleans up extra whitespace in code blocks
- Preserves formatting for `<code>` and `<pre>` elements

### `UnescapeTreeprocessor`

Restores characters that were escaped during earlier processing phases.

**Features:**
- Uses regex pattern to find escaped character codes
- Processes element text, tail, and attribute values
- Skips unescaping within `<code>` elements to preserve literal content

## Usage Notes

### Processing Order
Tree processors run in priority order (highest to lowest):
1. **InlineProcessor (20)** - Must run first to handle inline patterns
2. **PrettifyTreeprocessor (10)** - Formats the structure
3. **UnescapeTreeprocessor (0)** - Final cleanup of escaped characters

### AtomicString Protection
Use `markdown.util.AtomicString` to prevent text from being processed by inline patterns:

```python
element.text = markdown.util.AtomicString("This text won't be processed")
```

### Extension Development
When creating custom tree processors:
- Extend the `Treeprocessor` base class
- Implement the `run()` method
- Register with appropriate priority in the registry
- Consider ancestor context when processing nested elements

## Implementation Considerations

- **Performance**: The `InlineProcessor` is complex and processes text recursively
- **Memory**: Stashed nodes are kept in memory during processing
- **Compatibility**: Supports both old and new style inline pattern processors
- **Safety**: Includes placeholder validation to prevent malformed replacements

This module is essential for converting the parsed Markdown tree structure into properly formatted HTML with all inline elements correctly processed.
