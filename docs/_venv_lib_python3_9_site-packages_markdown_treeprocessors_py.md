# Python Markdown Tree Processors

## Overview

This module contains tree processors for the Python Markdown library. Tree processors are components that manipulate the ElementTree object created by block processors after the initial parsing phase but before serialization to HTML. They provide a way to make final adjustments, add collected references, create summaries, or perform other tree-wide operations.

## Purpose

Tree processors serve as the final processing stage in the Markdown-to-HTML conversion pipeline:
1. **Block processors** parse Markdown text into an ElementTree structure
2. **Tree processors** (this module) manipulate and refine the tree
3. **Serializers** convert the final tree to HTML output

## Key Functions

### `build_treeprocessors(md: Markdown, **kwargs: Any) -> util.Registry[Treeprocessor]`

Builds and registers the default tree processors for Markdown processing.

**Registered processors (in order of priority):**
- `InlineProcessor` (priority 20) - Processes inline patterns
- `PrettifyTreeprocessor` (priority 10) - Adds formatting line breaks
- `UnescapeTreeprocessor` (priority 0) - Restores escaped characters

### `isString(s: object) -> bool`

Utility function that returns `True` if the object is a string but not an `AtomicString`. This is important for determining whether text should be processed by inline patterns.

## Core Classes

### `Treeprocessor` (Base Class)

Abstract base class for all tree processors.

**Key Method:**
- `run(root: etree.Element) -> etree.Element | None`: Subclasses must implement this method to process the ElementTree

### `InlineProcessor`

The most complex tree processor that applies inline patterns (like emphasis, links, images) to text content within the parsed tree.

**Key Features:**
- Processes inline Markdown syntax within block elements
- Uses placeholder system to handle nested processing
- Maintains ancestor tracking to prevent invalid nesting
- Handles both text content and tail content of elements

**Important Methods:**
- `run(tree, ancestors=None)`: Main processing method that traverses the tree
- `__handleInline(data, patternIndex=0)`: Processes text with inline patterns
- `__processPlaceholders(data, parent, isText=True)`: Converts placeholders back to elements

### `PrettifyTreeprocessor`

Adds appropriate line breaks and whitespace to make the generated HTML more readable.

**Features:**
- Adds line breaks around block-level elements
- Handles `<br>` tags specially
- Preserves formatting in `<code>` and `<pre>` blocks
- Cleans up extra empty lines in code blocks

**Key Method:**
- `_prettifyETree(elem)`: Recursively adds formatting to elements

### `UnescapeTreeprocessor`

Restores characters that were escaped during earlier processing phases.

**Features:**
- Processes text content, tail content, and attribute values
- Uses regex pattern to find and restore escaped character codes
- Preserves literal content in `<code>` elements

**Key Methods:**
- `unescape(text)`: Converts escaped character codes back to actual characters
- `_unescape(match)`: Helper method for regex substitution

## Usage Notes

### Processing Order
The tree processors run in priority order (highest to lowest):
1. **InlineProcessor** - Must run first to handle inline syntax
2. **PrettifyTreeprocessor** - Adds formatting after content is finalized  
3. **UnescapeTreeprocessor** - Final cleanup of escaped characters

### AtomicString Usage
To prevent text from being processed by inline patterns, use `AtomicString`:

```python
from markdown.util import AtomicString
node.text = AtomicString("This text won't be processed for inline patterns")
```

### Custom Tree Processors
To create custom tree processors:

```python
class CustomTreeprocessor(Treeprocessor):
    def run(self, root):
        # Your custom processing logic here
        for elem in root.iter():
            # Process elements as needed
            pass
        return root  # or return None if modifying in place
```

## Important Considerations

- **Performance**: Tree processors operate on the entire document tree, so complex operations can impact performance
- **Order dependency**: Some processors depend on others running first (e.g., UnescapeTreeprocessor should run last)
- **Placeholder system**: InlineProcessor uses a sophisticated placeholder system to handle nested inline patterns safely
- **Ancestor tracking**: InlineProcessor maintains ancestor lists to prevent invalid HTML nesting

## Dependencies

- `xml.etree.ElementTree`: For XML/HTML tree manipulation
- `markdown.util`: For utility functions and AtomicString
- `markdown.inlinepatterns`: For inline pattern processing
- `re`: For regular expression operations
