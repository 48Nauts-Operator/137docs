# URL Filter Module

## Overview

This module serves as a **legacy re-export** for the `url_filter` function from the templates submodule. It provides backward compatibility by maintaining access to the URL filtering functionality through this module while the actual implementation has been moved to a more appropriate location.

## Purpose

- **Legacy Support**: Maintains backward compatibility for existing code that imports `url_filter` from this module
- **Code Organization**: Acts as a bridge while the codebase transitions to importing directly from the templates module
- **Import Convenience**: Provides a stable import path for the URL filtering functionality

## Exports

### `url_filter`

Re-exported from `.templates.url_filter`

```python
from module_name import url_filter
```

This function is imported from the templates submodule and made available through this module for legacy compatibility purposes.

## Technical Notes

- **Import Style**: Uses relative import (`.templates`) indicating this is part of a package structure
- **NoQA Comment**: The `# noqa: F401` comment suppresses linting warnings about unused imports, which is appropriate since this is an intentional re-export
- **Legacy Pattern**: This is a common pattern used during code refactoring to maintain API compatibility

## Usage Recommendations

### ✅ Current Usage (Legacy)
```python
from this_module import url_filter
```

### 🔄 Recommended Future Usage
```python
from package.templates import url_filter
```

## Migration Notes

> **⚠️ Deprecation Notice**: This re-export exists for legacy compatibility. New code should import `url_filter` directly from the `templates` module.

### For Maintainers

- Consider adding a deprecation warning if this legacy import path will be removed in future versions
- Monitor usage of this import path to determine when it's safe to remove
- Update documentation and examples to use the direct import path

### For Developers

- **New Projects**: Import directly from `.templates` module
- **Existing Projects**: Plan migration to direct imports when convenient
- **Testing**: Ensure both import paths are tested if supporting legacy usage

## File Structure Context

```
package/
├── __init__.py
├── templates/
│   └── __init__.py  # Contains url_filter implementation
└── current_module.py  # This file - legacy re-export
```

This module represents a transitional state in code organization where functionality has been moved but the old import path is preserved for compatibility.
