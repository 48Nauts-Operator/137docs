# Infinity Types Module

## Overview

This module provides a Python implementation of positive and negative infinity concepts through singleton-like objects. It defines two complementary classes that represent mathematical infinity values with proper comparison operators and behavior.

## Purpose

- **Mathematical Operations**: Provides infinity values that behave correctly in mathematical comparisons
- **Sorting and Ordering**: Enables proper ordering of collections that may contain infinity values
- **Boundary Values**: Useful for algorithms that need sentinel values representing unbounded limits

## Classes

### `InfinityType`

Represents positive infinity (`∞`).

**Key Features:**
- Always compares as greater than any other object (except itself)
- Returns `False` for less-than and less-than-or-equal comparisons
- Can be negated to produce negative infinity

**Methods:**
- `__repr__()` → `str`: Returns `"Infinity"`
- `__hash__()` → `int`: Returns hash based on string representation
- `__lt__(other)` → `bool`: Always returns `False`
- `__le__(other)` → `bool`: Always returns `False`
- `__eq__(other)` → `bool`: Returns `True` only for other `InfinityType` instances
- `__gt__(other)` → `bool`: Always returns `True`
- `__ge__(other)` → `bool`: Always returns `True`
- `__neg__()` → `NegativeInfinityType`: Returns negative infinity

### `NegativeInfinityType`

Represents negative infinity (`-∞`).

**Key Features:**
- Always compares as less than any other object (except itself)
- Returns `False` for greater-than and greater-than-or-equal comparisons
- Can be negated to produce positive infinity

**Methods:**
- `__repr__()` → `str`: Returns `"-Infinity"`
- `__hash__()` → `int`: Returns hash based on string representation
- `__lt__(other)` → `bool`: Always returns `True`
- `__le__(other)` → `bool`: Always returns `True`
- `__eq__(other)` → `bool`: Returns `True` only for other `NegativeInfinityType` instances
- `__gt__(other)` → `bool`: Always returns `False`
- `__ge__(other)` → `bool`: Always returns `False`
- `__neg__()` → `InfinityType`: Returns positive infinity

## Singleton Instances

The module provides two pre-instantiated objects:

```python
Infinity = InfinityType()          # Positive infinity
NegativeInfinity = NegativeInfinityType()  # Negative infinity
```

## Usage Examples

```python
# Basic comparisons
print(Infinity > 1000000)  # True
print(NegativeInfinity < -1000000)  # True

# Equality checks
print(Infinity == Infinity)  # True
print(NegativeInfinity == NegativeInfinity)  # True
print(Infinity == NegativeInfinity)  # False

# Negation
print(-Infinity)  # -Infinity
print(-NegativeInfinity)  # Infinity

# Sorting with infinity values
values = [5, NegativeInfinity, 10, Infinity, -3]
sorted_values = sorted(values)
# Result: [-Infinity, -3, 5, 10, Infinity]
```

## Notes and Considerations

### ⚠️ Important Limitations

1. **Self-Comparison Logic Issue**: The current implementation has a logical flaw where:
   ```python
   Infinity > Infinity  # Returns True (should be False)
   NegativeInfinity < NegativeInfinity  # Returns True (should be False)
   ```

2. **Mathematical Inconsistency**: The comparison operators don't handle self-comparison correctly, which could lead to unexpected behavior in sorting algorithms.

### 🔧 Suggested Improvements

```python
# Recommended fix for comparison methods:
def __gt__(self, other: object) -> bool:
    return not isinstance(other, self.__class__)

def __lt__(self, other: object) -> bool:
    return not isinstance(other, self.__class__)
```

### 💡 Best Practices

- Use these objects as sentinel values for algorithms requiring boundary conditions
- Be cautious when using in mathematical operations that expect numeric types
- Consider the self-comparison behavior when implementing sorting or ordering logic
- These objects are hashable and can be used as dictionary keys or in sets
