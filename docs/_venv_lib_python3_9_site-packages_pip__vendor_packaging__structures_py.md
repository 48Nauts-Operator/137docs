# Infinity Types Module

## Overview

This module provides singleton-like implementations of positive and negative infinity types for Python. It defines two classes that represent mathematical infinity concepts with proper comparison operators and negation support.

## Purpose

- Provide infinity representations that can be used in comparisons and sorting operations
- Implement mathematical infinity behavior where positive infinity is greater than all other values
- Implement negative infinity behavior where negative infinity is less than all other values
- Support negation operations to convert between positive and negative infinity

## Classes

### `InfinityType`

Represents positive infinity (∞).

#### Key Methods

- **`__repr__()`**: Returns the string representation `"Infinity"`
- **`__hash__()`**: Provides hash functionality for use in sets and dictionaries
- **Comparison operators**:
  - `__lt__()`, `__le__()`: Always return `False` (nothing is greater than infinity)
  - `__gt__()`, `__ge__()`: Always return `True` (infinity is greater than everything)
  - `__eq__()`: Returns `True` only when compared to another `InfinityType` instance
- **`__neg__()`**: Returns `NegativeInfinity` when negated

#### Usage Example

```python
from infinity_module import Infinity

print(Infinity > 1000000)  # True
print(Infinity > float('inf'))  # True
print(Infinity == Infinity)  # True
print(-Infinity)  # -Infinity
```

### `NegativeInfinityType`

Represents negative infinity (-∞).

#### Key Methods

- **`__repr__()`**: Returns the string representation `"-Infinity"`
- **`__hash__()`**: Provides hash functionality for use in sets and dictionaries
- **Comparison operators**:
  - `__lt__()`, `__le__()`: Always return `True` (negative infinity is less than everything)
  - `__gt__()`, `__ge__()`: Always return `False` (nothing is less than negative infinity)
  - `__eq__()`: Returns `True` only when compared to another `NegativeInfinityType` instance
- **`__neg__()`**: Returns `Infinity` when negated

#### Usage Example

```python
from infinity_module import NegativeInfinity

print(NegativeInfinity < -1000000)  # True
print(NegativeInfinity < float('-inf'))  # True
print(NegativeInfinity == NegativeInfinity)  # True
print(-NegativeInfinity)  # Infinity
```

## Module-Level Objects

- **`Infinity`**: Singleton instance of `InfinityType`
- **`NegativeInfinity`**: Singleton instance of `NegativeInfinityType`

## Usage Notes

### Best Practices

- Use the singleton instances `Infinity` and `NegativeInfinity` rather than creating new instances
- These objects work well in sorting operations and as boundary values
- Can be used as default values in functions where you need extreme values

### Example Use Cases

```python
# Finding maximum in a list with a default
def find_max(values, default=NegativeInfinity):
    return max(values) if values else default

# Setting boundaries
min_value = NegativeInfinity
max_value = Infinity

# Sorting with infinity values
mixed_list = [1, 5, Infinity, -3, NegativeInfinity, 10]
sorted_list = sorted(mixed_list)  # [-Infinity, -3, 1, 5, 10, Infinity]
```

### Important Considerations

- These infinity types will compare as greater/less than Python's built-in `float('inf')` and `float('-inf')`
- The equality comparison only returns `True` when comparing instances of the same class
- Hash values are based on the string representation, making these objects usable in sets and as dictionary keys
