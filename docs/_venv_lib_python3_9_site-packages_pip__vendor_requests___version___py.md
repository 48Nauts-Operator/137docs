# Requests Library Metadata

## Overview

This file serves as the **metadata configuration** for the popular Python `requests` library. It defines essential package information that is used throughout the library and by package management tools like pip.

## Purpose

The primary purposes of this file are to:

- Define package metadata and version information
- Provide author and licensing details
- Store configuration data used by setup tools and package managers
- Maintain centralized library information

## Package Information

### Core Metadata

| Attribute | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `__title__` | "requests" | Official package name |
| `__description__` | "Python HTTP for Humans." | Brief package description |
| `__url__` | "https://requests.readthedocs.io" | Documentation URL |
| `__version__` | "2.32.3" | Current version string |
| `__build__` | `0x023203` | Hexadecimal build number |

### Author & Legal Information

```python
__author__ = "Kenneth Reitz"
__author_email__ = "me@kennethreitz.org"
__license__ = "Apache-2.0"
__copyright__ = "Copyright Kenneth Reitz"
```

### Special Attributes

- `__cake__` = "✨ 🍰 ✨" - A fun Easter egg attribute with cake and sparkle emojis

## Usage Notes

### Version Information
- **Current Version**: 2.32.3
- **Build Number**: The hexadecimal value `0x023203` corresponds to decimal `143875`
- Version follows semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)

### Accessing Metadata
Other parts of the requests library can import and use these values:

```python
import requests
print(requests.__version__)  # "2.32.3"
print(requests.__author__)   # "Kenneth Reitz"
```

## Important Considerations

### For Developers
- **Do not modify** these values unless you're officially maintaining the requests library
- The `__build__` number should be updated with each release
- Version string should follow semantic versioning standards

### For Users
- This metadata is automatically included when you install requests via pip
- Use `requests.__version__` to check your installed version programmatically
- The documentation URL provides comprehensive usage examples and API reference

## ASCII Art Header

The file includes decorative ASCII art spelling "REQUESTS" at the top, which is a common practice in the Python community for adding personality to code files.
