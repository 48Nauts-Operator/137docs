# requests.certs Module Documentation

## Overview

The `requests.certs` module is a simple utility module that provides access to the default CA (Certificate Authority) certificate bundle used by the requests library for SSL/TLS certificate verification.

## Purpose

This module serves as a centralized location for retrieving the path to the trusted CA certificate bundle, which is essential for:

- **SSL/TLS Certificate Verification**: Validating the authenticity of HTTPS connections
- **Secure HTTP Requests**: Ensuring requests can verify server certificates against trusted CAs
- **Package Management Flexibility**: Allowing system administrators and package maintainers to customize the CA bundle location

## Key Components

### Imported Functions

#### `where()`
```python
from pip._vendor.certifi import where
```

- **Source**: `pip._vendor.certifi` package
- **Returns**: String path to the CA certificate bundle file
- **Purpose**: Locates the default CA certificate bundle provided by the certifi package

## Module Behavior

### Command Line Execution
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(where())
```

When run directly as a script, the module will:
- Execute the `where()` function
- Print the full path to the CA certificate bundle to stdout

**Example output:**
```
/path/to/python/site-packages/pip/_vendor/certifi/cacert.pem
```

## Usage Examples

### As a Module Import
```python
from requests.certs import where

# Get the path to CA certificates
ca_bundle_path = where()
print(f"CA Bundle located at: {ca_bundle_path}")
```

### Command Line Usage
```bash
python -m requests.certs
# or
python requests/certs.py
```

## Important Notes

### For Package Maintainers
> **⚠️ Customization Warning**: If you are packaging the requests library for:
> - Linux distributions
> - Managed environments
> - Enterprise deployments
>
> You can modify the `where()` function definition to return a path to a separately packaged CA bundle that meets your organization's security requirements.

### Dependencies
- **certifi package**: This module relies on the certifi package (via pip's vendored copy)
- **pip**: Uses pip's internal vendor directory for the certifi package

## Security Considerations

- The CA certificate bundle is critical for SSL/TLS security
- Always ensure the certificate bundle is from a trusted source
- Keep the certifi package updated to receive the latest CA certificate updates
- When customizing for package distribution, verify the alternative CA bundle is properly maintained
