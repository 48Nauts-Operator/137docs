# requests.hooks

## Overview

The `requests.hooks` module provides the core functionality for the Requests library's hooks system. This module enables users to register callback functions that are automatically executed at specific points during the HTTP request/response lifecycle.

## Purpose

This module allows developers to:
- Register custom callback functions to be executed during request processing
- Modify or inspect data at specific points in the request lifecycle
- Extend the functionality of the Requests library without modifying its core code

## Available Hooks

Currently, the module supports the following hook types:

- **`response`**: Triggered when a response is generated from a request

## Constants

### `HOOKS`
```python
HOOKS = ["response"]
```
A list containing all available hook event types. Currently only contains `"response"`.

> **Note**: There's a TODO comment indicating that `response` is currently the only implemented hook type, suggesting potential for future expansion.

## Functions

### `default_hooks()`

```python
def default_hooks():
    return {event: [] for event in HOOKS}
```

**Purpose**: Creates and returns a default hooks dictionary with empty lists for each available hook type.

**Returns**: 
- `dict`: A dictionary where keys are hook event names and values are empty lists

**Example**:
```python
# Returns: {"response": []}
hooks = default_hooks()
```

### `dispatch_hook(key, hooks, hook_data, **kwargs)`

```python
def dispatch_hook(key, hooks, hook_data, **kwargs):
    """Dispatches a hook dictionary on a given piece of data."""
```

**Purpose**: Executes all registered hook functions for a specific event type and processes the data through each hook sequentially.

**Parameters**:
- `key` (str): The hook event type to dispatch (e.g., "response")
- `hooks` (dict): Dictionary containing hook functions organized by event type
- `hook_data`: The data to be passed through the hook functions
- `**kwargs`: Additional keyword arguments passed to each hook function

**Returns**: 
- The processed `hook_data` after being passed through all registered hook functions

**Behavior**:
- If `hooks` is `None` or empty, returns the original `hook_data` unchanged
- Handles both single callable functions and lists of functions
- Executes hooks sequentially, allowing each hook to modify the data
- If a hook returns `None`, the original data is preserved
- If a hook returns non-`None` data, it replaces the current `hook_data`

**Example Usage**:
```python
def my_response_hook(response, **kwargs):
    print(f"Response status: {response.status_code}")
    return response

hooks = {"response": [my_response_hook]}
processed_response = dispatch_hook("response", hooks, response_object)
```

## Implementation Notes

### Flexibility in Hook Registration
The `dispatch_hook` function is designed to handle hooks registered in multiple formats:
- Single callable function
- List of callable functions

### Data Flow
Hook functions can either:
- **Inspect only**: Return `None` to leave data unchanged
- **Transform**: Return modified data to replace the original

### Error Handling
> **⚠️ Important**: The current implementation doesn't include explicit error handling for hook execution. Consider wrapping hook calls in try-catch blocks in production environments.

## Future Enhancements

Based on the TODO comment, additional hook types may be added in future versions. Potential candidates might include:
- `request`: Before sending a request
- `pre_request`: Before request preparation
- `post_request`: After request completion

## Usage Example

```python
import requests
from requests.hooks import default_hooks, dispatch_hook

# Create default hooks structure
hooks = default_hooks()

# Add a custom response hook
def log_response(response, **kwargs):
    print(f"Received response: {response.status_code}")
    return response

hooks["response"].append(log_response)

# The dispatch_hook function would be called internally by the requests library
# dispatch_hook("response", hooks, response_data)
```
