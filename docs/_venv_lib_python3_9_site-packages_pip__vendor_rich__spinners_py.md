# Spinner Definitions

This file contains a comprehensive collection of spinner animation definitions for command-line interface (CLI) applications. The spinners provide visual feedback to users during long-running operations or loading states.

## Purpose

The file defines various animated spinner styles that can be used to indicate progress or activity in terminal applications. Each spinner is configured with timing intervals and frame sequences to create smooth animations.

## License Information

The spinner animations are sourced from the `cli-spinners` project by Sindre Sorhus and are distributed under the MIT License.

## Data Structure

### `SPINNERS` Dictionary

The main data structure is a dictionary where each key represents a spinner name, and the value contains configuration for that spinner:

```python
"spinner_name": {
    "interval": 80,           # Animation speed in milliseconds
    "frames": "⠋⠙⠹⠸⠼⠴⠦⠧⠇⠏"  # Animation frames (string or list)
}
```

#### Configuration Properties

- **`interval`**: Animation timing in milliseconds between frame transitions
- **`frames`**: Animation frames, can be:
  - A string where each character is a frame
  - A list of strings where each element is a frame

## Spinner Categories

### Dot-based Spinners
Various braille character animations creating rotating dot effects:
- `dots`, `dots2`, `dots3` through `dots12` - Different braille dot patterns
- `dots8Bit` - Extended braille character set
- `simpleDots`, `simpleDotsScrolling` - Basic dot animations

### Line and Shape Spinners
Simple geometric patterns:
- `line`, `line2` - Basic line rotations
- `pipe` - Box drawing characters
- `triangle` - Rotating triangular shapes
- `circle`, `circleQuarters`, `circleHalves` - Circular animations
- `arc` - Arc-based rotation

### Progress Bar Style
Spinners that simulate progress or movement:
- `material` - Material design style progress bar
- `bouncingBar` - Animated progress bar with bouncing effect
- `bouncingBall` - Ball bouncing within brackets
- `growVertical`, `growHorizontal` - Growing bar animations

### Character-based
Text character rotations:
- `star`, `star2` - Star and asterisk patterns
- `flip` - Flipping character animation
- `toggle` through `toggle13` - Various toggle patterns

### Emoji Spinners
Fun emoji-based animations:
- `smiley` - Alternating emoji faces
- `monkey` - See-no-evil monkey sequence
- `hearts` - Rotating colored hearts
- `clock` - Clock face progression
- `earth` - Rotating earth globes
- `moon` - Moon phases
- `weather` - Weather condition sequence

### Themed Animations
Special themed spinners:
- `christmas` - Holiday tree animation
- `runner` - Walking/running person
- `shark` - ASCII shark swimming
- `pong` - Pong game ball movement
- `grenade` - Explosion sequence

## Usage Examples

```python
# Access a specific spinner configuration
dots_spinner = SPINNERS["dots"]
print(f"Interval: {dots_spinner['interval']}ms")
print(f"Frames: {dots_spinner['frames']}")

# Get all available spinner names
spinner_names = list(SPINNERS.keys())

# Example of different frame formats
string_frames = SPINNERS["dots"]["frames"]      # String format
list_frames = SPINNERS["dots12"]["frames"]      # List format
```

## Implementation Notes

### Frame Format Variations
- **String frames**: Each character represents one animation frame
- **List frames**: Each list element is a complete frame (may contain multiple characters)

### Performance Considerations
- Intervals range from 17ms (very fast) to 400ms (slow)
- Faster intervals create smoother animations but use more CPU
- Choose appropriate speed based on application needs

### Unicode Support
- Many spinners use Unicode characters (braille, geometric shapes, emoji)
- Ensure terminal/console supports Unicode rendering
- Consider fallback options for environments with limited Unicode support

## Recommendations

### Choosing a Spinner
- **Simple environments**: Use `line`, `pipe`, or `simpleDots`
- **Modern terminals**: Try `dots`, `material`, or emoji-based spinners
- **Branding/theming**: Select spinners that match your application's style
- **Performance-critical**: Choose spinners with longer intervals (100ms+)

### Integration Tips
- Test spinner visibility in target terminal environments
- Consider accessibility - some users may have difficulty with fast animations
- Provide options to disable or customize spinner styles
- Ensure proper cleanup when operations complete
