# Timer Context Manager

## Overview

This module provides a simple debugging utility for measuring and printing execution time of code blocks. It implements a context manager that tracks elapsed time and outputs the results in milliseconds.

## Purpose

- **Debugging Tool**: Primarily designed for development and debugging purposes
- **Performance Monitoring**: Helps identify execution time bottlenecks in code
- **Simple Timing**: Provides an easy-to-use interface for timing code blocks without manual start/stop timing logic

## Functions

### `timer(subject: str = "time")`

A context manager that measures and prints the elapsed execution time of a code block.

**Parameters:**
- `subject` (str, optional): A descriptive label for the timed operation. Defaults to "time".

**Returns:**
- `Generator[None, None, None]`: Context manager generator

**Behavior:**
1. Records the start time when entering the context
2. Yields control to execute the wrapped code block
3. Calculates elapsed time when exiting the context
4. Prints the elapsed time in milliseconds with one decimal place precision

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from timer_module import timer

# Time a simple operation
with timer():
    # Your code here
    result = sum(range(1000000))
# Output: time elapsed 45.2ms
```

### Custom Subject Label
```python
with timer("database query"):
    # Database operation
    records = fetch_user_records()
# Output: database query elapsed 152.3ms
```

### Multiple Timing Points
```python
with timer("data processing"):
    data = load_data()
    
with timer("analysis"):
    results = analyze_data(data)
    
with timer("report generation"):
    generate_report(results)
# Output: 
# data processing elapsed 89.7ms
# analysis elapsed 245.1ms  
# report generation elapsed 67.3ms
```

## Implementation Details

- Uses Python's built-in `time.time()` for timestamp measurement
- Leverages `@contextlib.contextmanager` decorator for clean context manager implementation
- Converts elapsed seconds to milliseconds for more readable output
- Prints directly to stdout using `print()`

## Notes and Suggestions

### Current Limitations
- **Debug Only**: As noted in the docstring, this is intended only for debugging
- **Print to stdout**: Always prints to console, no option to redirect or suppress output
- **No Return Value**: Elapsed time is only printed, not returned for programmatic use

### Potential Improvements

1. **Conditional Output**: Add a debug flag to control output
   ```python
   def timer(subject: str = "time", debug: bool = True):
   ```

2. **Return Elapsed Time**: Allow access to timing data
   ```python
   # Could yield a timing object instead of None
   with timer("operation") as t:
       # code here
       pass
   print(f"Operation took {t.elapsed_ms}ms")
   ```

3. **Flexible Output**: Support different output destinations
   ```python
   def timer(subject: str = "time", logger=None):
   ```

4. **Production Safety**: Add environment checks to prevent accidental use in production
   ```python
   import os
   if os.getenv('DEBUG', '').lower() == 'true':
       # only time in debug mode
   ```

### Best Practices

- Use descriptive subjects for better debugging output
- Remove timer calls before production deployment
- Consider using logging instead of print statements for better control
- Nest timers carefully to avoid confusion in output
