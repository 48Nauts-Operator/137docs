# Styled Module Documentation

## Overview

The `Styled` module provides a wrapper class that applies styling to any renderable object in the Rich library. This module is part of a larger terminal formatting system and allows users to apply visual styles (colors, formatting, etc.) to content without modifying the original renderable object.

## Purpose

- **Style Application**: Wraps any renderable object with a style that will be applied when rendered
- **Non-destructive Styling**: Applies styles without modifying the original renderable object
- **Rich Protocol Integration**: Implements Rich's rendering protocols for seamless integration

## Dependencies

The module imports from several related modules:
- `measure.Measurement`: For measuring renderable dimensions
- `segment.Segment`: For handling styled text segments
- `style.StyleType`: For style type definitions
- Console-related types (imported conditionally for type checking)

## Classes

### `Styled`

The main class that wraps a renderable object with a style.

#### Constructor

```python
def __init__(self, renderable: "RenderableType", style: "StyleType") -> None:
```

**Parameters:**
- `renderable`: Any object that can be rendered by Rich
- `style`: A style specification (color, formatting, etc.)

**Attributes:**
- `self.renderable`: Stores the original renderable object
- `self.style`: Stores the style to be applied

#### Methods

##### `__rich_console__()`

```python
def __rich_console__(self, console: "Console", options: "ConsoleOptions") -> "RenderResult":
```

**Purpose:** Implements Rich's console rendering protocol

**Process:**
1. Resolves the style using the console's `get_style()` method
2. Renders the wrapped renderable object
3. Applies the style to all rendered segments
4. Returns the styled segments

##### `__rich_measure__()`

```python
def __rich_measure__(self, console: "Console", options: "ConsoleOptions") -> Measurement:
```

**Purpose:** Implements Rich's measurement protocol

**Returns:** The measurement of the wrapped renderable (styling doesn't affect dimensions)

## Usage Example

The module includes a demonstration in the `__main__` block:

```python
from pip._vendor.rich import print
from pip._vendor.rich.panel import Panel

panel = Styled(Panel("hello"), "on blue")
print(panel)
```

This example:
- Creates a Panel with "hello" text
- Wraps it with a blue background style
- Prints the styled panel

## Key Features

- **Decorator Pattern**: Uses the decorator pattern to add styling behavior
- **Protocol Compliance**: Implements Rich's `__rich_console__` and `__rich_measure__` protocols
- **Style Preservation**: Maintains both the original renderable and the style separately
- **Flexible Styling**: Accepts any `StyleType` for maximum flexibility

## Notes and Suggestions

### ‚úÖ Best Practices
- Use `Styled` when you need to apply temporary styling without modifying the original object
- Combine with other Rich renderables for complex layouts
- Style objects can be reused with different renderables

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations
- Styling is applied at render time, so performance impact is minimal
- The original renderable remains unchanged, making this safe for reuse
- Measurements are delegated to the wrapped renderable since styling doesn't affect dimensions

### üîß Potential Improvements
- Consider adding methods to modify or remove styles after creation
- Could benefit from style combination/layering capabilities
- Documentation could include more complex styling examples

## Integration

This class integrates seamlessly with Rich's rendering system and can be used anywhere a `RenderableType` is expected. It's particularly useful in scenarios where conditional styling is needed or when building reusable styled components.
