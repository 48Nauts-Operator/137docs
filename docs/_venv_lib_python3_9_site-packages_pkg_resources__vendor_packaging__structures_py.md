# Infinity Types Module

## Overview

This module provides implementations for positive and negative infinity types that can be used for comparison operations in Python. It defines singleton-like objects that behave mathematically like infinity values, making them useful for sorting, boundary conditions, and mathematical operations where infinite values are needed.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this module is to:
- Provide consistent infinity objects that can be compared with any other Python objects
- Enable proper sorting behavior when infinity values are needed
- Offer mathematical operations like negation between positive and negative infinity
- Support use cases such as priority queues, version comparison systems, or mathematical computations

## Classes and Objects

### `InfinityType`

A class that represents positive infinity.

#### Key Methods

- **`__repr__()`**: Returns the string representation `"Infinity"`
- **`__hash__()`**: Provides a hash value based on the string representation
- **Comparison methods**: 
  - `__lt__()`, `__le__()`: Always return `False` (nothing is greater than infinity)
  - `__gt__()`, `__ge__()`: Always return `True` (infinity is greater than everything)
  - `__eq__()`: Returns `True` only when compared with another `InfinityType` instance
  - `__ne__()`: Returns `False` only when compared with another `InfinityType` instance
- **`__neg__()`**: Returns the `NegativeInfinity` object when negated

#### Usage Example

```python
from infinity import Infinity

print(Infinity > 1000000)  # True
print(Infinity == Infinity)  # True
print(-Infinity)  # -Infinity
```

### `NegativeInfinityType`

A class that represents negative infinity.

#### Key Methods

- **`__repr__()`**: Returns the string representation `"-Infinity"`
- **`__hash__()`**: Provides a hash value based on the string representation
- **Comparison methods**:
  - `__lt__()`, `__le__()`: Always return `True` (negative infinity is less than everything)
  - `__gt__()`, `__ge__()`: Always return `False` (nothing is less than negative infinity)
  - `__eq__()`: Returns `True` only when compared with another `NegativeInfinityType` instance
  - `__ne__()`: Returns `False` only when compared with another `NegativeInfinityType` instance
- **`__neg__()`**: Returns the `Infinity` object when negated

#### Usage Example

```python
from infinity import NegativeInfinity

print(NegativeInfinity < -1000000)  # True
print(NegativeInfinity == NegativeInfinity)  # True
print(-NegativeInfinity)  # Infinity
```

## Singleton Objects

### `Infinity`
A singleton instance of `InfinityType` that represents positive infinity.

### `NegativeInfinity`
A singleton instance of `NegativeInfinityType` that represents negative infinity.

## Usage Notes

### Best Practices
- Use the singleton objects `Infinity` and `NegativeInfinity` rather than creating new instances
- These objects are particularly useful in sorting algorithms and priority queues
- They work well as sentinel values for maximum/minimum boundaries

### Example Use Cases

```python
# Sorting with infinity values
values = [1, 5, Infinity, -3, NegativeInfinity, 10]
sorted_values = sorted(values)
# Result: [NegativeInfinity, -3, 1, 5, 10, Infinity]

# Using as default maximum value
def find_minimum(items, default=Infinity):
    return min(items) if items else default

# Priority queue boundaries
max_priority = NegativeInfinity  # Highest priority
min_priority = Infinity          # Lowest priority
```

### Important Considerations

- **Comparison Logic**: The comparison methods always return boolean values based on mathematical infinity properties
- **Hash Consistency**: Both types implement `__hash__()` making them usable as dictionary keys or in sets
- **Type Safety**: Equality checks use `isinstance()` to ensure type consistency
- **Negation Symmetry**: `-Infinity` returns `NegativeInfinity` and vice versa
