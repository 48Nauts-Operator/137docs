# packaging._typing Module

## Overview

This module provides a workaround for static type checking in the `packaging` library when the `typing` module cannot be reliably imported at runtime. It implements a clean solution for enabling type checking with `mypy` while avoiding runtime dependencies on the `typing` module.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this module is to:

- Enable static type analysis with `mypy` without requiring `typing` to be available at runtime
- Provide a vendorable solution for type checking (since `typing` itself is not vendorable)
- Offer a clean abstraction for conditional type imports throughout the packaging codebase

## Background

The `typing` module presents challenges for vendorable libraries because:
- It uses separate sources for Python 2 and Python 3
- It cannot be reliably vendored into other codebases
- The packaging library needs to work without assuming `typing` is present

This module solves these issues by using `mypy`'s support for conditional imports behind falsy guards.

## Exported Items

### `TYPE_CHECKING`

```python
TYPE_CHECKING = False  # at runtime
```

- **Type**: `bool`
- **Runtime Value**: `False`
- **Type Checker Value**: `True` (when imported from `typing`)
- **Purpose**: Used as a guard for conditional type imports

### `cast`

```python
def cast(type_, value):
    return value
```

- **Purpose**: Runtime-safe implementation of `typing.cast`
- **Parameters**:
  - `type_`: The target type (ignored at runtime)
  - `value`: The value to cast
- **Returns**: The original value unchanged
- **Behavior**: Acts as identity function at runtime, provides type casting hints for static analysis

## Usage Pattern

Throughout the packaging codebase, static typing imports should follow this pattern:

```python
from packaging._typing import TYPE_CHECKING

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from typing import List, Dict, Optional
    # other type imports...

# Your code here with type annotations in comments or function signatures
```

## Implementation Details

### Conditional Import Logic

The module uses a clever conditional import pattern:

```python
if False:  # pragma: no cover
    from typing import TYPE_CHECKING
else:
    TYPE_CHECKING = False
```

- The `if False:` block is never executed at runtime but is analyzed by type checkers
- Type checkers see the import from `typing.TYPE_CHECKING` (which is `True`)
- At runtime, `TYPE_CHECKING` is explicitly set to `False`

### Cast Function Implementation

```python
if TYPE_CHECKING:  # pragma: no cover
    from typing import cast
else:
    def cast(type_, value):
        return value
```

- Type checkers see the real `typing.cast` function
- Runtime gets a simple identity function that returns the value unchanged
- No runtime overhead or dependencies

## Notes and Considerations

### Pragma Coverage

- `# pragma: no cover` is used to exclude type-checking-only code blocks from coverage reports
- These blocks are never executed at runtime, so they shouldn't affect coverage metrics

### MyPy Compatibility

- This implementation is specifically designed to work with `mypy`'s type checking behavior
- Reference: [MyPy Issue #3216](https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/3216)

### Maintenance Guidelines

- All static typing imports in the packaging library should use this pattern
- Avoid importing `typing` directly at module level
- Use type comments when necessary to avoid runtime type dependencies

## Best Practices

1. **Always use the guard**: Import `TYPE_CHECKING` from this module, not directly from `typing`
2. **Consistent pattern**: Follow the established conditional import pattern throughout the codebase
3. **Type comments**: Consider using type comments instead of annotations when types aren't available at runtime
4. **Documentation**: Keep this module's documentation updated as the primary reference for typing patterns in the project
