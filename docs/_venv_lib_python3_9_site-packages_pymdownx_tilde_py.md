# pymdownx.tilde

A Markdown extension that adds support for strikethrough (delete) and subscript text formatting using tilde characters.

## Overview

The `pymdownx.tilde` extension enables you to create:
- **Strikethrough text** using `~~text~~` which renders as `<del>text</del>`
- **Subscript text** using `~text~` which renders as `<sub>text</sub>`

This extension is part of the PyMdown Extensions collection and provides intelligent parsing with configurable smart detection.

## Syntax Examples

```markdown
~~This text is deleted/strikethrough~~
~This text is subscript~
~~~This can be both delete and subscript~~~
```

## Key Classes and Functions

### Core Processor Classes

#### `TildeProcessor`
The main processor for handling both delete and subscript patterns when smart mode is disabled.

- Handles complex nested patterns like `~~~del,sub~~~`, `~~del~~`, and `~sub~`
- Uses regex patterns to match various tilde combinations
- Inherits from `util.PatternSequenceProcessor`

#### `TildeSmartProcessor`
Enhanced processor with smart detection capabilities.

- Provides intelligent word boundary detection
- Avoids false positives with tildes surrounded by whitespace
- Better handling of connected words like `~~word1~~word2~~`

#### Specialized Processors

- **`TildeSubProcessor`**: Handles only subscript (`~text~`) patterns
- **`TildeDeleteProcessor`**: Handles only strikethrough (`~~text~~`) patterns  
- **`TildeSmartDeleteProcessor`**: Smart strikethrough-only processing

### Main Extension Class

#### `DeleteSubExtension`

The primary extension class that integrates with Markdown.

**Configuration Options:**

```python
{
    'smart_delete': [True, "Treat ~~connected~~words~~ intelligently"],
    'delete': [True, "Enable delete/strikethrough"],
    'subscript': [True, "Enable subscript"]
}
```

**Key Methods:**

- `__init__()`: Initializes configuration options
- `extendMarkdown()`: Registers processors and escape characters with Markdown

## Regular Expression Patterns

The extension uses sophisticated regex patterns to handle various tilde combinations:

- `DEL_SUB`: `~~~text~~~` - Triple tildes for combined delete/subscript
- `DEL`: `~~text~~` - Double tildes for strikethrough
- `SUB`: `~text~` - Single tildes for subscript
- Smart variants with word boundary detection

## Usage

### Basic Setup

```python
import markdown
from pymdownx import tilde

md = markdown.Markdown(extensions=['pymdownx.tilde'])
```

### With Configuration

```python
md = markdown.Markdown(
    extensions=['pymdownx.tilde'],
    extension_configs={
        'pymdownx.tilde': {
            'smart_delete': True,
            'delete': True,
            'subscript': True
        }
    }
)
```

### Factory Function

```python
def makeExtension(*args, **kwargs):
    """Return extension."""
    return DeleteSubExtension(*args, **kwargs)
```

## Important Notes

### Smart Mode Benefits
- **Enabled by default** for better text processing
- Prevents unintended formatting in normal text containing tildes
- Uses word boundary detection for more accurate parsing

### Pattern Priority
The extension processes patterns in a specific order to handle nested and overlapping tilde usage correctly.

### Escape Characters
The extension automatically registers `~` (and space in some cases) as escape characters in Markdown.

### Processing Order
Registered at priority level 65-70 in Markdown's inline pattern processing pipeline.

## Suggestions

1. **Keep smart_delete enabled** unless you have specific requirements for exact character matching
2. **Test complex nested patterns** if using multiple tilde combinations in the same text
3. **Consider disabling unused features** (delete or subscript) for performance if only using one type
4. **Be aware of escape sequences** when you need literal tilde characters in your text
