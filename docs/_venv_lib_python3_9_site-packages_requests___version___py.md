# Requests Library Metadata

## Overview

This file contains metadata and package information for the `requests` library, a popular Python HTTP client library. The file serves as a central location for defining package constants and information that can be used throughout the library and by packaging tools.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this file is to:

- Define package metadata in a centralized location
- Provide version information for the library
- Store author and licensing information
- Make package information accessible to other modules and tools

## Package Information

### Basic Metadata

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Title** | `requests` |
| **Description** | Python HTTP for Humans |
| **URL** | https://requests.readthedocs.io |
| **Version** | 2.32.3 |
| **License** | Apache-2.0 |

### Author Information

- **Author**: Kenneth Reitz
- **Email**: me@kennethreitz.org
- **Copyright**: Copyright Kenneth Reitz

### Technical Details

```python
__build__ = 0x023203  # Hexadecimal build number
__cake__ = "\u2728 \U0001f370 \u2728"  # Unicode decorative element (‚ú®üç∞‚ú®)
```

## Code Structure

The file follows Python packaging conventions by using double-underscore variables (`__variable__`) to define package metadata:

```python
__title__ = "requests"
__description__ = "Python HTTP for Humans."
__url__ = "https://requests.readthedocs.io"
__version__ = "2.32.3"
__build__ = 0x023203
__author__ = "Kenneth Reitz"
__author_email__ = "me@kennethreitz.org"
__license__ = "Apache-2.0"
__copyright__ = "Copyright Kenneth Reitz"
__cake__ = "\u2728 \U0001f370 \u2728"
```

## Usage Notes

### Accessing Package Information

Other modules can import and use this metadata:

```python
from requests import __version__, __author__, __description__

print(f"Using requests v{__version__} by {__author__}")
print(f"Description: {__description__}")
```

### Build Information

- The `__build__` variable uses hexadecimal notation (`0x023203`)
- This likely corresponds to the version number (2.32.03) in hex format
- Build numbers help with internal versioning and debugging

## Notes and Suggestions

### Best Practices

- ‚úÖ **Good**: Uses standard Python packaging metadata conventions
- ‚úÖ **Good**: Centralizes all package information in one location
- ‚úÖ **Good**: Includes comprehensive metadata (version, author, license, etc.)

### Considerations

- The `__cake__` variable appears to be decorative/humorous and serves no functional purpose
- Consider using semantic versioning practices for the `__version__` field
- The build number format should be documented if used programmatically

### Integration

This metadata is typically used by:

- Package managers (pip, conda)
- Setup/build tools (setuptools, poetry)
- Documentation generators
- Version checking utilities
- License compliance tools

## ASCII Art Header

The file includes decorative ASCII art at the top spelling "REQUESTS", which adds personality to the codebase while maintaining the library's friendly, human-centered philosophy.
