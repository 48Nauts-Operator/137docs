# Requests Library Metadata Module

## Overview

This Python file contains metadata and package information for the **Requests** library, a popular HTTP library for Python. The file serves as a central location for storing package constants, version information, and author details that are used throughout the library and by packaging tools.

## Purpose

- **Package Identification**: Defines core package metadata like name, version, and description
- **Documentation Reference**: Provides URL to official documentation
- **Author Information**: Contains author details and licensing information
- **Version Management**: Centralizes version information for consistent usage across the library

## Package Metadata

### Basic Information
- **Package Name**: `requests`
- **Description**: "Python HTTP for Humans."
- **Version**: `2.32.3`
- **Documentation URL**: https://requests.readthedocs.io

### Author & License

### Technical Details

#### Version Information
```python
__version__ = "2.32.3"
__build__ = 0x023203  # Hexadecimal build number
```

The build number `0x023203` is a hexadecimal representation that corresponds to the version components:
- `02` ‚Üí Major version (2)
- `32` ‚Üí Minor version (32) 
- `03` ‚Üí Patch version (3)

#### Special Elements
```python
__cake__ = "\u2728 \U0001f370 \u2728"  # ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú®
```

## Notes and Suggestions

### Usage Patterns
This metadata is typically used by:
- **Setup tools** for package installation and distribution
- **Documentation generators** to display version and author information
- **IDE tools** for package information display
- **Runtime code** that needs to access version information

### Best Practices
- **Import Usage**: Access metadata using `import requests; requests.__version__`
- **Version Checking**: Use for compatibility checks in dependent code
- **Documentation**: Reference `__url__` for linking to official documentation

### ASCII Art Header
The decorative ASCII art header spelling "REQUESTS" adds a distinctive visual element to the source code, making it easily identifiable and adding personality to the library.

## Integration Notes

This metadata file is essential for:
- Package managers (pip) to identify and install the correct version
- Dependency management tools to resolve version conflicts
- Documentation systems to display accurate package information
- Development tools to provide contextual information about the library
