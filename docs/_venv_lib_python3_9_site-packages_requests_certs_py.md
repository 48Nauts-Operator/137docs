# requests.certs Module Documentation

## Overview

The `requests.certs` module is a simple utility module that provides access to the default CA (Certificate Authority) certificate bundle used by the Requests library for SSL/TLS certificate verification.

## Purpose

This module serves as a centralized location for obtaining the path to the CA certificate bundle that Requests uses to verify SSL certificates when making HTTPS requests. By default, it leverages the `certifi` package, which provides Mozilla's carefully curated collection of Root Certificates.

## Key Components

### Imported Functions

#### `where()`
- **Source**: `certifi` package
- **Returns**: String path to the CA certificate bundle file
- **Purpose**: Locates and returns the file path of the default CA certificate bundle

## Usage

### As a Module
```python
from requests.certs import where

# Get the path to the CA certificate bundle
cert_bundle_path = where()
print(cert_bundle_path)
# Output: /path/to/site-packages/certifi/cacert.pem
```

### As a Script
```bash
python -m requests.certs
# or
python requests/certs.py
```

This will print the path to the CA certificate bundle to stdout.

## Implementation Details

The module contains minimal code:
- Imports the `where` function directly from `certifi`
- Includes a command-line interface that prints the certificate bundle path when run as a script

## Notes and Considerations

### For Package Maintainers
- **Customization Point**: The documentation explicitly mentions that package maintainers (e.g., for Linux distributions) can modify the `where()` function definition to point to a system-provided CA bundle instead of the bundled certifi certificates.

### Example Customization
```python
# Custom implementation for system package maintainers
def where():
    return '/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt'  # System CA bundle
```

### Security Implications
- This module is critical for SSL/TLS security in the Requests library
- The CA bundle it provides is used to verify the authenticity of SSL certificates
- Any modifications should be made carefully to maintain security

### Dependencies
- **certifi**: Required dependency that provides the Mozilla CA certificate bundle
- The certifi package is regularly updated to include the latest trusted root certificates

## Related Information

- The `certifi` package is maintained separately and provides regular updates to the CA certificate bundle
- This module acts as an abstraction layer, allowing for easy substitution of different CA bundles if needed
- The returned path typically points to a `.pem` file containing multiple concatenated CA certificates
