# requests.certs Module Documentation

## Overview

The `requests.certs` module is a simple utility module that provides access to the default Certificate Authority (CA) certificate bundle used by the Requests library. This module serves as a thin wrapper around the `certifi` package to provide SSL certificate validation capabilities.

## Purpose

This module exists to:
- Provide a centralized location for CA certificate bundle management
- Allow for easy customization of the certificate bundle location for package maintainers
- Enable SSL/TLS certificate verification for HTTPS requests

## Module Structure

### Imports

```python
from certifi import where
```

The module imports the `where` function from the `certifi` package, which returns the path to the bundled CA certificate file.

### Main Execution

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(where())
```

When run as a standalone script, the module prints the path to the CA certificate bundle.

## Key Components

### Functions

#### `where()`
- **Source**: Imported from `certifi.where`
- **Purpose**: Returns the file path to the CA certificate bundle
- **Return Type**: String (file path)
- **Usage**: Used internally by Requests to locate SSL certificates for verification

## Usage Examples

### As a Module
```python
from requests.certs import where

# Get the path to the CA certificate bundle
cert_path = where()
print(f"CA certificates located at: {cert_path}")
```

### As a Script
```bash
python -m requests.certs
# Output: /path/to/site-packages/certifi/cacert.pem
```

## Dependencies

- **certifi**: Provides the curated collection of Root Certificates for validating SSL certificates

## Notes for Package Maintainers

### Customization
The module documentation specifically mentions that package maintainers can customize the certificate bundle location:

> If you are packaging Requests, e.g., for a Linux distribution or a managed environment, you can change the definition of where() to return a separately packaged CA bundle.

### Example Customization
```python
# Custom implementation for system-specific CA bundle
def where():
    return "/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt"  # Ubuntu/Debian
    # or return "/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt"  # RHEL/CentOS
```

## Security Considerations

- The CA certificate bundle is crucial for SSL/TLS security
- Ensure any custom certificate bundle is regularly updated
- Verify the integrity of certificate bundles when packaging for distribution

## Related Components

This module is typically used in conjunction with:
- `requests.adapters` - HTTP adapter implementations
- `requests.sessions` - Session management with SSL verification
- SSL/TLS verification throughout the Requests library

## File Information

- **Shebang**: `#!/usr/bin/env python` (executable as script)
- **Module Path**: `requests.certs`
- **Dependencies**: `certifi`
