# requests.hooks

## Overview

The `requests.hooks` module provides the hook system capabilities for the Python Requests library. This module implements a simple but flexible event-driven architecture that allows users to register callback functions that are executed at specific points during HTTP request processing.

## Purpose

The hooks system enables users to:
- Intercept and modify HTTP responses before they are returned to the calling code
- Add custom processing logic at specific points in the request lifecycle
- Implement middleware-like functionality for HTTP requests

## Available Hooks

Currently, the module supports the following hook events:

- **`response`**: Triggered when an HTTP response is generated from a request

## Constants

### `HOOKS`
```python
HOOKS = ["response"]
```
- **Type**: List of strings
- **Description**: Defines all available hook event names in the system
- **Note**: Currently only contains "response", with a TODO comment indicating it's the only implemented hook

## Functions

### `default_hooks()`

```python
def default_hooks():
    return {event: [] for event in HOOKS}
```

- **Returns**: Dictionary with hook event names as keys and empty lists as values
- **Purpose**: Creates the default hook structure for new request instances
- **Usage**: Initializes the hooks dictionary with empty callback lists for each available hook type

**Example return value:**
```python
{"response": []}
```

### `dispatch_hook(key, hooks, hook_data, **kwargs)`

```python
def dispatch_hook(key, hooks, hook_data, **kwargs):
    """Dispatches a hook dictionary on a given piece of data."""
```

- **Parameters**:
  - `key` (str): The hook event name to dispatch
  - `hooks` (dict): Dictionary containing hook callbacks organized by event name
  - `hook_data`: The data object to be processed by the hooks (typically a Response object)
  - `**kwargs`: Additional keyword arguments passed to hook functions

- **Returns**: The processed hook data (potentially modified by hook functions)

- **Behavior**:
  - Safely handles missing or None hooks dictionary
  - Supports both single callable and list of callables for hook events
  - Executes hooks sequentially, allowing each to modify the data
  - Returns the final modified data after all hooks have been executed

## Usage Example

```python
# Example of how hooks might be used
def my_response_hook(response, *args, **kwargs):
    """Custom hook that adds a header to responses"""
    print(f"Response status: {response.status_code}")
    return response  # Return modified response if needed

# Setting up hooks (typically done internally by requests)
hooks = default_hooks()
hooks['response'].append(my_response_hook)

# Dispatching hooks (done internally during request processing)
processed_response = dispatch_hook('response', hooks, response_object)
```

## Notes and Suggestions

### Current Limitations
- Only the `response` hook is currently implemented
- The TODO comment suggests this is a work in progress

### Design Patterns
- The module follows a simple observer pattern
- Hook functions can modify data by returning a new value
- Graceful handling of edge cases (None hooks, single vs. multiple callbacks)

### Best Practices
- Hook functions should be lightweight to avoid impacting request performance
- Always return the data object (modified or unmodified) from hook functions
- Consider thread safety if using hooks in multi-threaded applications

### Potential Enhancements
- Additional hook points could be added (e.g., `request`, `error`, `redirect`)
- Hook priority system for controlling execution order
- Async hook support for non-blocking operations
