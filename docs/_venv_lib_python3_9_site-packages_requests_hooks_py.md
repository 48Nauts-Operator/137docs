# requests.hooks

## Overview

The `requests.hooks` module provides the hook system capabilities for the Requests library. This module implements a simple but powerful event-driven architecture that allows users to register callback functions that will be executed at specific points during the HTTP request/response lifecycle.

## Purpose

The hooks system enables:
- **Extensibility**: Users can inject custom logic into the request/response processing
- **Middleware-like functionality**: Modify or inspect data at specific execution points
- **Event-driven architecture**: Respond to specific events during HTTP operations

## Available Hooks

Currently, the module supports the following hooks:

- **`response`**: Triggered when a response is generated from a request

> **Note**: The TODO comment indicates that `response` is currently the only implemented hook, suggesting that additional hooks may be added in future versions.

## Constants

### `HOOKS`
```python
HOOKS = ["response"]
```
A list containing all available hook event names. Currently only contains `"response"`.

## Functions

### `default_hooks()`

```python
def default_hooks():
    return {event: [] for event in HOOKS}
```

**Purpose**: Creates and returns a default hooks dictionary with empty lists for each available hook event.

**Returns**: 
- `dict`: A dictionary mapping each hook event name to an empty list

**Usage Example**:
```python
hooks = default_hooks()
# Returns: {"response": []}
```

### `dispatch_hook(key, hooks, hook_data, **kwargs)`

```python
def dispatch_hook(key, hooks, hook_data, **kwargs):
    """Dispatches a hook dictionary on a given piece of data."""
```

**Purpose**: Executes all registered hook functions for a specific event, passing the hook data through each function in sequence.

**Parameters**:
- `key` (str): The hook event name to dispatch
- `hooks` (dict): Dictionary containing hook functions organized by event name
- `hook_data`: The data to pass through the hook functions
- `**kwargs`: Additional keyword arguments to pass to hook functions

**Returns**: 
- The final `hook_data` after being processed by all hook functions

**Behavior**:
1. Retrieves the list of hook functions for the specified key
2. Handles both single callable and list of callables
3. Executes each hook function in sequence
4. If a hook function returns a value, it replaces the `hook_data` for subsequent hooks
5. Returns the final processed data

**Usage Example**:
```python
def my_response_hook(response, **kwargs):
    print(f"Response status: {response.status_code}")
    return response

hooks = {"response": [my_response_hook]}
processed_response = dispatch_hook("response", hooks, response_object)
```

## Implementation Notes

### Hook Function Flexibility
The `dispatch_hook` function gracefully handles both:
- **Single callable**: Automatically converts to a list
- **List of callables**: Processes each function in order

### Data Flow
Hook functions can modify the data being processed:
- If a hook function returns `None`, the original data is preserved
- If a hook function returns a value, that value becomes the new data for subsequent hooks

### Error Handling
> **Suggestion**: Consider adding error handling to prevent a single faulty hook from breaking the entire chain.

## Development Notes

- The TODO comment suggests this module is in active development
- Additional hook types may be added in future versions
- Consider the current implementation as a foundation for more extensive hook capabilities

## Usage Recommendations

1. **Hook Functions Should Be Idempotent**: Design hook functions to be safe to call multiple times
2. **Return Values**: Be explicit about when to return modified data vs. `None`
3. **Performance**: Keep hook functions lightweight to avoid impacting request performance
4. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling within hook functions
