# requests/packages.py

## Overview

This file provides backwards compatibility for the `requests` library by creating package aliases for vendored dependencies. It allows legacy code to continue importing packages like `urllib3`, `idna`, and `chardet` from the `requests.packages` namespace.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this module is to maintain backwards compatibility with older versions of the `requests` library that used to vendor (bundle) certain dependencies within the `requests.packages` namespace. Modern versions of `requests` use these packages as external dependencies, but this module ensures that existing code using the old import paths continues to work.

## How It Works

The module performs the following operations:

### 1. Standard Package Aliasing

For `urllib3` and `idna` packages:

```python
for package in ("urllib3", "idna"):
    locals()[package] = __import__(package)
    # Module traversal and aliasing logic
```

- Imports each package dynamically
- Creates aliases in `sys.modules` mapping `requests.packages.<module>` to the actual module
- Preserves object identities so that `requests.packages.urllib3.*` is identical to `urllib3.*`

### 2. Character Detection Package Handling

For the `chardet` package (with special handling):

```python
if chardet is not None:
    target = chardet.__name__
    # Special aliasing logic for chardet variants
```

- Handles potential `chardet` alternatives (like `charset-normalizer`)
- Creates dual aliases to support both the actual package name and the `chardet` alias

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Import Resolution**: Uses `__import__()` to dynamically load packages
- **Module Identity Preservation**: Ensures that aliased modules maintain the same object identity as the original modules
- **Flexible Character Detection**: Adapts to different character detection libraries through the `compat` module

## Dependencies

- `sys`: For module registry manipulation
- `.compat.chardet`: Character detection library (may be `chardet` or `charset-normalizer`)

## Usage Example

With this module, legacy code can continue to work:

```python
# Old way (still supported)
from requests.packages.urllib3 import PoolManager

# New way (recommended)
from urllib3 import PoolManager
```

## Notes and Recommendations

⚠️ **Deprecation Notice**: This module exists solely for backwards compatibility. The comment in the code reflects the maintainers' sentiment about this approach.

### Recommendations:

- **For New Code**: Import packages directly (`urllib3`, `idna`, `chardet`) rather than through `requests.packages`
- **For Legacy Code**: Consider updating import statements when possible to use direct imports
- **Library Maintainers**: Be aware that this compatibility layer may be removed in future major versions

### Technical Considerations:

- The module manipulates `sys.modules` directly, which can have implications for module loading and introspection
- The traversal logic ensures that submodules are also properly aliased
- Special handling for `chardet` accommodates different character detection library implementations

## Migration Path

To modernize code using this compatibility layer:

```python
# Instead of:
from requests.packages.urllib3.poolmanager import PoolManager
from requests.packages.idna import encode

# Use:
from urllib3.poolmanager import PoolManager
from idna import encode
```
