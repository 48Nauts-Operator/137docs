# HTTP Connection Interface Documentation

## Overview

This Python file defines type annotations and protocols for HTTP connection interfaces in what appears to be part of a urllib3-like HTTP client library. The file establishes contracts for both HTTP and HTTPS connections, along with supporting data structures for proxy configuration and response handling.

## Purpose

- Define type-safe interfaces for HTTP/HTTPS connections
- Establish contracts for connection behavior and required methods
- Provide configuration structures for proxy and SSL settings
- Enable static type checking for HTTP client implementations

## Key Components

### Type Definitions

#### `_TYPE_BODY`
```python
_TYPE_BODY = typing.Union[bytes, typing.IO[typing.Any], typing.Iterable[bytes], str]
```
- Defines acceptable types for HTTP request bodies
- Supports various data formats: raw bytes, file-like objects, iterables, and strings

### Data Classes

#### `ProxyConfig`
```python
class ProxyConfig(typing.NamedTuple):
    ssl_context: ssl.SSLContext | None
    use_forwarding_for_https: bool
    assert_hostname: None | str | typing.Literal[False]
    assert_fingerprint: str | None
```

**Purpose**: Configuration container for proxy-related SSL settings

**Fields**:
- `ssl_context`: Custom SSL context for proxy connections
- `use_forwarding_for_https`: Whether to use HTTP forwarding for HTTPS requests through proxy
- `assert_hostname`: Hostname verification settings
- `assert_fingerprint`: Expected SSL certificate fingerprint

#### `_ResponseOptions`
```python
class _ResponseOptions(typing.NamedTuple):
    request_method: str
    request_url: str
    preload_content: bool
    decode_content: bool
    enforce_content_length: bool
```

**Purpose**: Internal configuration for response handling behavior

> **Note**: This class is marked with a TODO comment indicating it should be replaced with better HTTP request/response lifecycle tracking.

### Protocol Interfaces

#### `BaseHTTPConnection`

**Purpose**: Defines the contract for basic HTTP connections

**Key Attributes**:
- `host`, `port`: Connection target
- `timeout`: Request timeout configuration
- `proxy`: Proxy URL configuration
- `is_verified`: SSL verification status

**Essential Methods**:

- `connect()`: Establish connection to the target server
- `request()`: Send HTTP request with comprehensive options
- `getresponse()`: Retrieve HTTP response
- `close()`: Close the connection
- `set_tunnel()`: Configure HTTP tunneling (typically for proxies)

**Connection State Properties**:
- `is_closed`: Whether connection is new or previously closed
- `is_connected`: Whether actively connected to any origin
- `has_connected_to_proxy`: Whether successfully connected through proxy

#### `BaseHTTPSConnection`

**Purpose**: Extends `BaseHTTPConnection` with SSL/TLS-specific functionality

**Additional SSL Attributes**:
- Certificate verification: `cert_reqs`, `assert_hostname`, `assert_fingerprint`
- Certificate authority: `ca_certs`, `ca_cert_dir`, `ca_cert_data`
- TLS version control: `ssl_minimum_version`, `ssl_maximum_version`
- Client certificates: `cert_file`, `key_file`, `key_password`

## Important Features

### Connection Management
- **State Tracking**: Clear separation between closed, connected, and proxy-connected states
- **Proxy Support**: Built-in proxy configuration and tunneling capabilities
- **SSL/TLS Configuration**: Comprehensive SSL settings for secure connections

### Type Safety
- Extensive use of type hints and protocols for static analysis
- Support for both modern union syntax (`|`) and traditional `typing.Union`
- Protocol-based design allows for flexible implementations

## Usage Notes

### Best Practices
- Always check connection state using the provided properties before operations
- Use appropriate SSL configuration for production environments
- Handle proxy authentication and tunneling appropriately

### Considerations
- The `_ResponseOptions` class is marked for future refactoring
- SSL version parameter is deprecated in favor of minimum/maximum version settings
- Some parameters use ellipsis (`...`) as defaults, indicating implementation-specific defaults

### Dependencies
This module depends on:
- `ssl` module for SSL/TLS functionality
- Custom utility modules for connection, timeout, and URL handling
- A separate `response` module for HTTP response handling

## Implementation Requirements

Classes implementing these protocols must:
1. Provide all required methods with matching signatures
2. Maintain proper connection state management
3. Handle SSL/TLS configuration correctly for HTTPS connections
4. Support proxy tunneling and authentication
5. Implement proper resource cleanup in `close()` method
