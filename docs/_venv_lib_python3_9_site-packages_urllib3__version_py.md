# Version Module Documentation

## Overview

This module is an auto-generated version information file created by `setuptools-scm`. It provides standardized access to version information for the Python package.

> **⚠️ Important**: This file is automatically generated and should not be manually edited or tracked in version control.

## Purpose

The module serves as a centralized location for version information, allowing other parts of the application to import and use version data consistently. This is a common pattern in Python packages to make version information programmatically accessible.

## Exported Variables

The module exports four main variables through `__all__`:

### Version Strings
- **`__version__`**: Standard Python package version string
- **`version`**: Alias for `__version__`

### Version Tuples  
- **`__version_tuple__`**: Version as a tuple of integers/strings
- **`version_tuple`**: Alias for `__version_tuple__`

## Current Version Information

```python
__version__ = "2.4.0"
__version_tuple__ = (2, 4, 0)
```

## Type Annotations

The module includes conditional type checking support:

```python
if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from typing import Tuple, Union
    VERSION_TUPLE = Tuple[Union[int, str], ...]
else:
    VERSION_TUPLE = object
```

This provides proper type hints for development tools while avoiding runtime dependencies on the `typing` module.

## Usage Examples

### Importing Version Information

```python
# Import specific version info
from module_name import __version__, __version_tuple__

# Import all version variables
from module_name import __version__, version, __version_tuple__, version_tuple

# Use in your code
print(f"Running version {__version__}")
print(f"Version tuple: {__version_tuple__}")
```

### Checking Version Compatibility

```python
from module_name import __version_tuple__

if __version_tuple__ >= (2, 4, 0):
    # Use newer features
    pass
else:
    # Fallback for older versions
    pass
```

## Notes and Best Practices

### For Developers
- **Never manually edit this file** - it will be overwritten by `setuptools-scm`
- **Do not track in version control** - let the build process generate it
- Use the exported variables to access version info throughout your codebase

### For Package Maintainers
- Ensure `setuptools-scm` is properly configured in your build process
- The version information is automatically derived from your VCS tags
- Both string and tuple formats are provided for different use cases

### Type Safety
- The module provides proper type annotations for static analysis
- The `VERSION_TUPLE` type allows for flexible version tuple formats
- Type checking is conditionally imported to minimize runtime overhead

## Integration with setuptools-scm

This file is part of the `setuptools-scm` workflow:

1. `setuptools-scm` reads version information from your VCS (Git tags, etc.)
2. Generates this module with the current version
3. Your package can import and use the version information
4. The version stays synchronized with your repository tags
