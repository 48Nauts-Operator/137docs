# HTTP Response Utility Module

This module provides utility functions for working with HTTP responses and file-like objects in the urllib3 library. It contains helper functions for checking file object states, validating HTTP header parsing, and determining HTTP request methods.

## Purpose

The module serves as a collection of low-level utility functions that support urllib3's HTTP handling capabilities:

- Determining if file-like objects are closed
- Validating HTTP header parsing for potential errors
- Identifying HEAD request responses

## Functions

### `is_fp_closed(obj: object) -> bool`

Checks whether a given file-like object is closed by trying multiple detection methods.

**Parameters:**
- `obj`: The file-like object to check

**Returns:**
- `bool`: True if the object is closed, False otherwise

**Raises:**
- `ValueError`: If unable to determine the closed state

**Implementation Details:**
The function tries three different approaches in order:
1. Calls `obj.isclosed()` method (handles Python 3 edge cases)
2. Checks `obj.closed` attribute (standard file-like object approach)
3. Checks if `obj.fp is None` (for container objects like HTTPResponse)

```python
# Example usage
if is_fp_closed(response):
    print("Response stream is closed")
```

### `assert_header_parsing(headers: httplib.HTTPMessage) -> None`

Validates that HTTP headers have been parsed correctly and raises an exception if parsing errors are detected.

**Parameters:**
- `headers`: HTTPMessage object containing parsed headers

**Raises:**
- `TypeError`: If headers parameter is not an HTTPMessage instance
- `HeaderParsingError`: If parsing errors are found

**Key Features:**
- Extracts parsing defects from header objects
- Ignores known harmless defects related to multipart responses:
  - `StartBoundaryNotFoundDefect`
  - `MultipartInvariantViolationDefect`
- Detects unparsed data in non-multipart messages

```python
# Example usage
try:
    assert_header_parsing(response.msg)
except HeaderParsingError as e:
    print(f"Header parsing failed: {e}")
```

### `is_response_to_head(response: httplib.HTTPResponse) -> bool`

Determines if an HTTP response originated from a HEAD request.

**Parameters:**
- `response`: HTTPResponse object to check

**Returns:**
- `bool`: True if the response is from a HEAD request, False otherwise

```python
# Example usage
if is_response_to_head(response):
    print("This response came from a HEAD request")
```

## Dependencies

- `http.client` (httplib): Standard library HTTP client
- `email.errors`: For multipart parsing error detection
- `..exceptions.HeaderParsingError`: Custom urllib3 exception

## Important Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings and Limitations

1. **Private API Usage**: The `is_response_to_head()` function accesses the private `_method` attribute of HTTPResponse objects, which may be subject to change in future Python versions.

2. **Python Version Compatibility**: The `assert_header_parsing()` function is designed specifically for Python 3 and leverages email parsing infrastructure.

3. **Error Handling**: The `is_fp_closed()` function uses a fallback approach with multiple try-except blocks, which may mask unexpected attribute errors.

### üí° Suggestions for Improvement

- Consider adding type hints for better IDE support and documentation
- The `is_response_to_head()` function could benefit from a more robust method that doesn't rely on private attributes
- Add logging for debugging purposes, especially in the fallback logic of `is_fp_closed()`

## Usage Context

This module is typically used internally by urllib3 for:
- Connection pooling and resource management
- HTTP response validation
- Request/response lifecycle management

It's not intended for direct use by end users but rather as supporting infrastructure for the urllib3 library.
