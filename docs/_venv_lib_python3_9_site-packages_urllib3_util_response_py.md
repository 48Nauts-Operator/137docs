# HTTP Response Utilities

This module provides utility functions for working with HTTP responses and file-like objects in the context of HTTP communication. It's designed to handle common operations and edge cases when dealing with HTTP responses, headers, and file objects.

## Purpose

The module serves as a collection of helper functions that:
- Determine the state of file-like objects
- Validate HTTP header parsing results
- Identify HTTP request methods from responses

## Functions

### `is_fp_closed(obj: object) -> bool`

Checks whether a given file-like object is closed by attempting multiple detection methods.

**Parameters:**
- `obj` (object): The file-like object to check

**Returns:**
- `bool`: True if the object is closed, False otherwise

**Raises:**
- `ValueError`: If unable to determine the closed state

**Implementation Details:**
The function uses a fallback approach with three different methods:
1. Calls `obj.isclosed()` method (Python 3 compatibility)
2. Checks `obj.closed` attribute (standard file-like object approach)
3. Checks if `obj.fp is None` (for container objects like HTTPResponse)

```python
# Example usage
with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:
    print(is_fp_closed(f))  # False

print(is_fp_closed(f))  # True (after context manager closes it)
```

### `assert_header_parsing(headers: httplib.HTTPMessage) -> None`

Validates that HTTP headers have been parsed correctly and raises an exception if parsing errors are detected.

**Parameters:**
- `headers` (http.client.HTTPMessage): Headers object to validate

**Raises:**
- `TypeError`: If the input is not an HTTPMessage instance
- `HeaderParsingError`: If parsing errors are found

**Key Features:**
- Filters out known harmless defects related to multipart responses
- Checks for unparsed data in non-multipart messages
- Ignores `StartBoundaryNotFoundDefect` and `MultipartInvariantViolationDefect`

```python
# Example usage
import http.client as httplib

# This would typically be called after receiving HTTP headers
try:
    assert_header_parsing(response_headers)
except HeaderParsingError as e:
    print(f"Header parsing failed: {e}")
```

### `is_response_to_head(response: httplib.HTTPResponse) -> bool`

Determines if an HTTP response originated from a HEAD request.

**Parameters:**
- `response` (http.client.HTTPResponse): The HTTP response to check

**Returns:**
- `bool`: True if the response is from a HEAD request, False otherwise

**Note:**
⚠️ **Warning**: This function accesses the private `_method` attribute of the HTTPResponse object, which may not be stable across Python versions.

```python
# Example usage
if is_response_to_head(response):
    print("This response came from a HEAD request")
```

## Dependencies

- `http.client`: Standard library HTTP client functionality
- `email.errors`: For multipart parsing error detection
- `..exceptions.HeaderParsingError`: Custom exception for header parsing failures

## Notes and Suggestions

### Potential Improvements

1. **Private Attribute Access**: The `is_response_to_head()` function relies on accessing `response._method`, which is a private attribute. Consider:
   - Adding error handling for cases where this attribute doesn't exist
   - Documenting the Python version compatibility
   - Looking for alternative approaches that don't rely on private attributes

2. **Type Hints**: The code uses proper type hints, but some functions use `# type: ignore` comments. Consider:
   - Adding protocol definitions for file-like objects
   - Using `typing.Protocol` for better type safety

3. **Error Handling**: The `is_fp_closed()` function could benefit from more specific error messages to help with debugging.

### Usage Context

This module appears to be part of a larger HTTP library (likely urllib3 based on the import structure) and is designed to handle edge cases and compatibility issues when working with HTTP responses across different Python versions and scenarios.
