# Database Migration: Baseline Revision

## Overview

This document describes the baseline database migration file `0001_baseline` for establishing Alembic version control on an existing database schema.

## Migration Details

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Revision ID** | `0001_baseline` |
| **Down Revision** | `None` (Initial migration) |
| **Branch Labels** | `None` |
| **Dependencies** | `None` |
| **Created** | 2025-05-19 12:00:00.000000 |

## Purpose

This migration serves as a **baseline revision** for an existing database schema. It allows Alembic to begin tracking database changes without modifying the current database structure.

### Key Characteristics

- **Non-destructive**: Does not alter existing database structure
- **Tracking initialization**: Establishes version control starting point
- **Schema preservation**: Maintains existing SQLAlchemy-managed schema

## Migration Functions

### `upgrade()`

```python
def upgrade():
    # Schema already managed via SQLAlchemy metadata create_all at startup.
    # This baseline allows Alembic to start tracking without altering the DB.
    pass
```

**Behavior**: No-operation (pass-through)

**Purpose**: 
- Registers the current schema state with Alembic
- Allows future migrations to build upon this baseline
- Prevents conflicts with existing SQLAlchemy metadata management

### `downgrade()`

```python
def downgrade():
    # Irreversible baseline ‚Äì no downgrade available.
    pass
```

**Behavior**: No-operation (pass-through)

**Purpose**: 
- Indicates this is an irreversible baseline migration
- Prevents accidental rollback attempts that could corrupt the schema

## Usage Context

This migration is typically used when:

1. **Introducing Alembic** to an existing project with an established database
2. **Transitioning** from manual schema management to version-controlled migrations
3. **Establishing** a known good state before implementing new schema changes

## Implementation Notes

### Prerequisites
- Database schema must already exist and be stable
- SQLAlchemy models should be in sync with the current database structure
- Alembic must be properly configured for the target database

### Post-Migration
- Future schema changes should be implemented through new Alembic migrations
- The baseline revision will serve as the foundation for all subsequent migrations
- Database versioning will be tracked from this point forward

## Important Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: This baseline migration assumes the existing database schema matches the current SQLAlchemy model definitions.

‚úÖ **Best Practice**: Verify schema consistency before applying this migration.

üîí **Irreversible**: This migration cannot be downgraded as it represents the initial state.

## Dependencies

- `alembic`: Database migration framework
- `sqlalchemy`: SQL toolkit and ORM

## Related Files

This migration should be accompanied by:
- Alembic configuration (`alembic.ini`)
- Migration environment setup (`env.py`)
- Current SQLAlchemy model definitions
