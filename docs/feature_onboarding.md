You're thinking about this exactly the right way ‚Äî the onboarding is not just a first-time setup, it's a context-aware module activator. To proceed efficiently, we can structure the implementation into 3 coordinated modules that interact cleanly and allow for expansion:

‚∏ª

üß© Modular Plan for Entity-Aware Onboarding & Multi-Company Support

üîß Overview of What We Need to Build

Component	Purpose
onboarding	Gathers user intent (personal vs business) and guides setup
entity module	Stores and manages companies (and private profile)
license/module router	Activates/deactivates UI features based on setup or marketplace actions


‚∏ª

‚úÖ Phase 1: Onboarding Module

üî® Create: modules/onboarding/

Includes:
	‚Ä¢	Wizard-style UI (Steps 1‚Äì3)
	‚Ä¢	State: user.intent = 'personal' | 'business' | 'mixed'
	‚Ä¢	Logic to pre-activate:
	‚Ä¢	entity module if business or mixed
	‚Ä¢	Store initial personal entity automatically

üìå Questions to Ask:
	1.	Are you using 137Docs for:
	‚Ä¢	( ) Personal
	‚Ä¢	( ) Business
	‚Ä¢	( ) Both
	2.	Want to add a business now?
	‚Ä¢	Yes ‚Üí go to business entity setup
	‚Ä¢	No ‚Üí load dashboard with personal entity

### üìú Mandatory Licence Agreement (new Step 0)
Before the intent selection, display a scrollable Licence Agreement and a checkbox:
- **Self-Hosted** ‚Äì user maintains infra, no SLA.
- **No Support / No Warranty** ‚Äì software provided *as-is* (MIT-style clause).
- **LLM Usage Costs** ‚Äì any API usage (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) billed directly to the user's own key.
- **Non-Commercial Restriction** ‚Äì this community edition may not be resold or offered as a hosted service.

User must tick "I have read and accept" ‚Üí enables **Continue**.  Store `tosAcceptedAt` timestamp in settings so wizard is skipped on subsequent logins.

Back-end guard: every authenticated request checks `settings.tosAcceptedAt` ‚Üí otherwise HTTP 451.

‚û°Ô∏è Upon completion, write config:

{
  "plan": "personal",
  "entities": [{ id: "personal", name: "Private", type: "individual" }],
  "enabledModules": ["core", "analytics", "calendar", "entity"]
}


‚∏ª

‚úÖ Phase 2: Entity Management Module

üî® Create: modules/entity/
	‚Ä¢	Handles:
	‚Ä¢	Entity switching logic
	‚Ä¢	Filtering of documents by entity_id
	‚Ä¢	Adding/editing companies
	‚Ä¢	Tags/keywords/VAT alias mapping
	‚Ä¢	Integrates with:
	‚Ä¢	Analytics
	‚Ä¢	Calendar
	‚Ä¢	Document ingest/metadata tagging

This module is conditionally enabled by onboarding or via Marketplace.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Phase 3: Marketplace Module Integration

üß© Add: "Add Company" Tile
	‚Ä¢	When clicked, trigger onboarding step subset
	‚Ä¢	"Let's set up your company..."
	‚Ä¢	Capture: name, address, VAT, IBAN
	‚Ä¢	Append to entities list and refresh filters

If onboarding was skipped initially, this retroactively enables the entity module and transforms the UI from personal-only ‚Üí multi-entity.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Phase 4: Routing & Settings Awareness
	‚Ä¢	Add logic to:
	‚Ä¢	Read onboarding state from settings on startup
	‚Ä¢	Inject modules accordingly
	‚Ä¢	Sidebar, dashboard filters, analytics will auto-adapt if:
	‚Ä¢	entities.length > 1
	‚Ä¢	or plan !== 'personal'

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Phase 5: (Optional) Entity Activation from Classifier

You could later detect documents that match business-style invoices and prompt:

"üëÄ This looks like a company invoice. Want to add Technopark AG as a business entity?"

Then trigger entity setup from within document context ‚Äî high-trust upgrade path.

üóÇÔ∏è Suggested Folder Structure

src/
  core/
  modules/
    onboarding/
      index.tsx
      Step1Intent.tsx
      Step2BusinessDetails.tsx
      utils/onboardingState.ts
    entity/
      index.tsx
      EntitySwitcher.tsx
      EntityEditor.tsx
      hooks/useEntityFilter.ts
    marketplace/
      AddCompanyCard.tsx


‚∏ª

üõ†Ô∏è Development Steps
	1.	Scaffold onboarding flow (3 steps)
	2.	Hook onboarding result into user config / plan
	3.	Build entity schema + management UI
	4.	Add dashboard filter logic based on active entity
	5.	Enable entity addition via marketplace tile

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Outcome
	‚Ä¢	Seamless onboarding with future-proofed entity logic
	‚Ä¢	Modular system: personal-only remains lean, business mode expands UX
	‚Ä¢	Licensing model naturally attached to complexity (1 entity = free, >1 = tiered)

## üèóÔ∏è Proposed Technical Architecture (v0.1 Draft)

### 1. Domain Model (Postgres)
| Table | Core fields | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| `entity` | id (UUID), name, type (individual\|company), address_json, vat_id, iban, created_at | One row per business or the implicit *personal* profile |
| `user_entity` | user_id  ‚Üí **users**.id, entity_id ‚Üí **entity**.id, role (owner\|member) | Allows later multi-user multi-entity setups |
| `document` | **add** `entity_id` FK nullable | All existing queries join on this id when entity module is active |
| `setting` | scope (global\|user), key, json_value | Onboarding wizard writes `plan`, `enabledModules`, `lastCompletedStep` here |

Migration strategy: new columns are nullable ‚Üí deploy without downtime, back-fill `entity_id = personal` for existing docs.

### 2. Backend Services
1. **OnboardingService**  (`/services/onboarding.py`)
   ‚Ä¢ CRUD helpers for reading/writing onboarding state in `setting` table.
2. **EntityService** (`/services/entity.py`)
   ‚Ä¢ CRUD for entities, validate VAT/IBAN, derive slug.
3. **MarketplaceService** (already stub) ‚Äì can reuse to enable modules.

Expose REST endpoints:
```
GET  /api/entities                ‚Üí list (filtered by current user)
POST /api/entities                ‚Üí create entity
PUT  /api/entities/{id}           ‚Üí update
POST /api/onboarding/complete     ‚Üí payload { plan, entities: [...] }
GET  /api/onboarding/status       ‚Üí returns wizard state
```

### 3. Frontend Modules
```
modules/
  onboarding/
    Wizard.tsx            ‚Äì orchestrates steps, writes tmp state to context
    steps/
      Intent.tsx          ‚Äì radio selection personal / business / both
      BusinessInfo.tsx    ‚Äì company form, validates VAT/IBAN
      Review.tsx          ‚Äì summary + Finish button
    hooks/useOnboarding.ts

  entity/
    EntityProvider.tsx    ‚Äì React Context with active entity + list
    EntitySwitcher.tsx    ‚Äì Small dropdown in navbar when >1 entity
    useEntityFilter.ts    ‚Äì wrap API calls to inject ?entity_id=‚Ä¶
```
Routing:
* `App.tsx` mounts `OnboardingGuard` high-up. If `onboarding.status!=='done'` ‚áí redirect to `/onboarding` wizard.

### 4. UI/UX Contracts
* Wizard uses **ShadCN** `Tabs` style; progress stored in `localStorage` so refresh doesn't lose data.
* After completion, it triggers `/onboarding/complete` then reloads the whole SPA so module router can re-hydrate with new config.
* Marketplace "Add Company" re-uses BusinessInfo step in a modal; on save posts to `/entities` and refreshes EntityProvider.

### 5. Module Router
Simple util that reads `settings.enabledModules` at startup and lazy-loads corresponding micro-frontends (split-chunks) so unused code isn't shipped to personal-only users.

## ‚ùì Open Questions
1. **Licensing tiers** ‚Äì  do we enforce entity count limits in backend or just hide the UI until a licence key is present?
2. **Permissions** ‚Äì for now single-user per workspace. Should we still model `user_entity` for future multi-user?
3. **Cross-entity search** ‚Äì default filter to active entity, but allow "All entities" in advanced search?
4. **Document re-assignment** ‚Äì need UI to move docs between entities?
5. **Email / Inbox segregation** ‚Äì will each entity get its own watched folder or share `/Inbox`?
6. **LLM context** ‚Äì include `entity_id` in embeddings namespace to avoid cross-polluting RAG answers?
7. **Analytics history** ‚Äì after enabling entity module mid-way, should old docs be auto-classified to entities via heuristic (sender VAT match)?

---

## üí° Implementation Thoughts & Next Steps
1. Ship DB migrations and EntityService first ‚Äì nothing breaks, even if frontend isn't ready.
2. Build onboarding wizard with mocked service ‚Üí iterate quickly.
3. Integrate EntityProvider into existing pages (InvoiceTable etc.) to pass `entity_id` param.
4. Only after that wire Marketplace "Add Company".
5. Write Cypress tests: onboarding flow; entity switcher filters docs; module router hides entity UI when disabled.

*Please review the open questions and confirm/adjust data-model choices before we start coding migrations.*
