## üöÄ Task: Smart Invoice Payment via QR Code Support

### üåê Goal

Enable the 137Docs system to support invoice payments through QR codes, either by:

* Reusing existing QR codes from uploaded invoices, or
* Generating QR codes based on parsed invoice data (IBAN, amount, reference, etc.)

This allows users to scan and pay invoices easily using their banking app, while the system tracks the payment status.

---

## ‚úÖ Deliverables

### 1. **QR Code Detection and Display (Phase 1)**

* Detect embedded QR codes from invoices (if available via ColVision)
* Extract payment data
* Display the QR code in the invoice view
* Allow user to mark invoice as paid manually

### 2. **QR Code Generation (Phase 2)**

* If no QR is found:

  * Generate a valid SEPA QR (EU) or Swiss QR (CH) from invoice data
  * Display as scannable QR code with matching payment fields below

### 3. **Payment Status Tracking**

* Let users manually mark invoice as paid and store:

  * `paid_at`
  * `payment_method`
  * Optional receipt or confirmation doc
