Perfect ‚Äî thanks for clarifying! You‚Äôre referring to browser-use ‚Äî a headless browser automation framework that wraps Puppeteer to make browser tasks easy, local, and scriptable. It‚Äôs essentially a streamlined way to run secure, local browser automations with Node.js, and it‚Äôs a great fit for your Document Management System.

üß© Why browser-use Fits Your Project

Your DMS is already:
	‚Ä¢	Local-first ‚úÖ
	‚Ä¢	Document-driven ‚úÖ
	‚Ä¢	Looking to extract invoices or bank statements from the web ‚úÖ
	‚Ä¢	Moving toward task automation and LLM awareness ‚úÖ

Now you need something that can log into supplier portals, download documents, and do so reliably without cloud dependencies.

browser-use does exactly that:
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Wraps Puppeteer with better defaults
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Ships with prebuilt task templates
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Runs fully locally (no cloud/headless farm)
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Easily integrates into cron jobs, CLI tools, or APIs
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Written in Node.js (but usable via scripts or child process calls from Python, Go, Rust, etc.)

‚úÖ Use Cases for browser-use in Your System

1. Automated Invoice Scraping
	‚Ä¢	Use browser-use scripts to:
	‚Ä¢	Log in to DigitalOcean, GCP, AWS, banking portals
	‚Ä¢	Navigate to the billing section
	‚Ä¢	Download the latest invoice PDFs
	‚Ä¢	Then send these to your DMS via API or save to the Inbox folder

2. Periodic Checks (Cron or Triggered)
	‚Ä¢	Schedule browser-use to run daily/weekly:

browser-use run fetch-latest-digitalocean-invoice.js



3. Invoice Validation + Extraction
	‚Ä¢	After download, pass invoice to OCR pipeline
	‚Ä¢	Use LLM to check if invoice is new, updated, or already paid

4. Browser-Assisted LLM Tasks
	‚Ä¢	Use browser-use to:
	‚Ä¢	Automate data entry into portals
	‚Ä¢	Cross-check invoice info online
	‚Ä¢	Retrieve payment status from a web interface

üõ† How to Integrate It

You can either:
	‚Ä¢	Call browser-use scripts as CLI from your DMS:
	‚Ä¢	Output PDFs to the DMS Inbox folder
	‚Ä¢	Trigger DMS to ingest after download

Or:
	‚Ä¢	Embed it as a background service:
	‚Ä¢	Create wrapper modules (e.g. digitalocean-scraper.js)
	‚Ä¢	Trigger based on due dates or scheduled tasks

‚∏ª

üß† Security + Privacy
	‚Ä¢	Local execution = full control
	‚Ä¢	No 3rd-party telemetry or cloud API
	‚Ä¢	Scripts and credentials stay on your machine
	‚Ä¢	Use .env for credentials or fetch them securely from your DMS vault

‚∏ª

üöÄ Pro Tip

Combine browser-use with your LLM timeline view:
	‚Ä¢	Let the timeline log ‚ÄúFetched invoice from GCP portal‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Automatically link invoice + metadata
	‚Ä¢	Display in context when reviewing vendor history
