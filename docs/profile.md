# What is a Tenant?
A Tenant is the user or organisation that is receiving the invoices or document. By adding the details, the LLM will be able to identify that you are the receiving party. For each Tenant the chosen Alias (aka Personal, Company A, Association, etc) will be added on the top menu. This allows you to quckly change the view to a single Tenant.

Say you want to see all documents send to you personal and work in your Personal space, click on the top Menu (Personal)
and a filter will only show documents addressed to your details or tagged as you. That way we can easy switch to other organisations and only display the data for that entitiy. Ensure to add all information so we can accuratly display the documents under the chosen Tenant.
