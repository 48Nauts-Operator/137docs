Secret management is crucial when integrating automation tools like browser-use, especially in a local-first, LLM-augmented system.

⸻

🔐 1. Secrets Stay Outside LLM Context

📌 Rule:

Never pass passwords, API keys, or tokens into the LLM context window — not even encrypted.

✅ Design Implication:
	•	Secrets are accessed by trusted code modules only (e.g. browser-use scripts, payment modules)
	•	LLM is used for high-level logic, never low-level execution with secrets

⸻

🗄️ 2. Secrets Storage Options (Local Only)

Option A: Environment Variables + .env file
	•	Use dotenv to load secrets locally
	•	Store secrets in a .env file, like:

DIGITALOCEAN_USER=andre@dat.ag
DIGITALOCEAN_PASS=sup3rs3cret

Pros: Simple, works with any language
Cons: You must ensure the file is .gitignored, encrypted at rest, and only readable by you

⸻

Option B: Encrypted Local Vault

Use a local secrets vault, such as:
	•	1Password CLI
	•	Pass
	•	keytar (Node.js wrapper for OS credential stores)
	•	macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, Linux Secret Service

The automation script fetches credentials at runtime:

DIGITALOCEAN_PASS=$(op read "op://Private/DO/Password")

Or in Node.js (with keytar):

const keytar = require('keytar');
const password = await keytar.getPassword('dms', 'digitalocean');

👁️ 3. LLM Guardrails

🔒 Limit LLM scope
	•	You can use the LLM to:
	•	Generate tasks (“Fetch latest AWS invoice”)
	•	Summarize documents
	•	Propose which invoices are due
	•	You cannot let it:
	•	Access secrets
	•	Compose login scripts with credentials
	•	Execute browser-use jobs

✅ Implementation Pattern:
	1.	LLM suggests a task: fetch_invoice("digitalocean")
	2.	A secure system handler receives this and:
	•	Loads secrets securely
	•	Executes browser-use with injected creds (env vars or vault)
	3.	Response goes back to LLM without exposing how it was done

⸻

🔁 4. Credential Rotation + Access Control
	•	Allow users (i.e. you) to update credentials in a local settings panel
	•	Support rotating passwords easily (trigger vault update + re-auth)
	•	Optionally log who/what accessed secrets (local audit logs)

⸻

✨ Optional UX Enhancement

In your dashboard:
	•	Add a Secrets tab:
	•	Shows services: AWS, GCP, Bank
	•	Shows connection status (e.g. ✅ authenticated / 🔄 expired)
	•	Allows secure re-auth flow

⸻

✅ Summary: Do this

Goal	Solution
Store secrets	.env (short term), vault (long term)
Don’t leak to LLM	Keep all secret access in trusted code
Secure browser-use	Inject creds via env vars or secure runtime
Rotate creds	Use local UI + secure store API
LLM + secrets separation	Use a task router pattern: LLM suggests, code executes
