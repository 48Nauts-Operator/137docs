# Database Migration - Baseline Revision

## Overview

This Python file is an **Alembic database migration script** that establishes a baseline revision for an existing database schema. It serves as the initial migration point for database version control without making any actual changes to the database structure.

## Purpose

- **Establishes version control**: Creates a starting point for Alembic to begin tracking database schema changes
- **Non-destructive initialization**: Allows migration tracking to begin on an existing database without altering its structure
- **Migration foundation**: Provides the base revision from which all future migrations will derive

## Migration Metadata

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Revision ID** | `0001_baseline` |
| **Parent Revision** | `None` (initial migration) |
| **Created** | 2025-05-19 12:00:00.000000 |
| **Branch Labels** | `None` |
| **Dependencies** | `None` |

## Key Functions

### `upgrade()`

```python
def upgrade():
    # Schema already managed via SQLAlchemy metadata create_all at startup.
    # This baseline allows Alembic to start tracking without altering the DB.
    pass
```

- **Purpose**: Defines the forward migration steps
- **Behavior**: No-op (does nothing) since the schema already exists
- **Use case**: Allows Alembic to mark this revision as "applied" without modifying the database

### `downgrade()`

```python
def downgrade():
    # Irreversible baseline – no downgrade available.
    pass
```

- **Purpose**: Defines the rollback steps for this migration
- **Behavior**: No-op since this is a baseline revision
- **Important**: This migration cannot be rolled back as it represents the initial state

## Technical Notes

### Dependencies

- **alembic**: Database migration framework
- **sqlalchemy**: SQL toolkit and ORM (imported but not used in this baseline)

### Architecture Considerations

- The existing schema is managed by SQLAlchemy's `metadata.create_all()` method at application startup
- This migration bridges the gap between direct SQLAlchemy schema management and Alembic-controlled migrations
- Future schema changes should be handled through proper Alembic migrations rather than direct SQLAlchemy calls

## Usage Guidelines

### ✅ Best Practices

- **Keep as-is**: This baseline should remain unchanged once applied
- **Future migrations**: All subsequent schema changes should create new migration files
- **Documentation**: Always document the existing schema state when creating baseline migrations

### ⚠️ Important Warnings

- **Irreversible**: This migration cannot be downgraded
- **One-time use**: Baseline migrations should only be created once per project
- **Schema consistency**: Ensure the existing database schema matches what SQLAlchemy expects before applying this migration

## Next Steps

1. Apply this migration to mark the current schema state: `alembic upgrade head`
2. Create new migrations for future schema changes: `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"`
3. Transition from using `metadata.create_all()` to relying solely on Alembic migrations
