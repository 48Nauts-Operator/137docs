# Database Migration: Add Disabled Column to Users

## Overview

This file is an **Alembic database migration** that adds a `disabled` column to the `users` table. Alembic is a database migration tool for SQLAlchemy that allows you to version and manage database schema changes over time.

## Purpose

- **Migration ID**: `20250524_user_disabled`
- **Previous Migration**: `20250523_user_cols`
- **Created**: May 24, 2025
- **Objective**: Add a boolean column to track whether user accounts are disabled

## Migration Details

### Upgrade Function

```python
def upgrade():
    try:
        op.execute("ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN disabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;")
    except Exception:
        # Column probably already exists
        pass
```

**What it does:**
- Adds a new `disabled` column to the `users` table
- Sets the column type to `BOOLEAN`
- Sets the default value to `FALSE` (users are enabled by default)
- Uses exception handling to prevent errors if the column already exists

### Downgrade Function

```python
def downgrade():
    # SQLite doesn't support DROP COLUMN, so we can't easily remove this column
    pass 
```

**What it does:**
- Currently does nothing (no-op)
- Contains a comment explaining the limitation with SQLite

## Key Components

### Migration Metadata
- **`revision`**: Unique identifier for this migration
- **`down_revision`**: References the previous migration in the chain
- **`branch_labels`**: None (linear migration path)
- **`depends_on`**: None (no external dependencies)

## Important Notes and Suggestions

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

1. **Irreversible Migration**: The downgrade function is empty because SQLite doesn't support `DROP COLUMN` operations
2. **Database Compatibility**: This migration assumes the target database supports boolean types

### üí° Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Better Error Handling**:
   ```python
   def upgrade():
       try:
           op.execute("ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN disabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;")
       except Exception as e:
           # Log the specific error for debugging
           print(f"Column may already exist: {e}")
   ```

2. **Database-Specific Downgrade**:
   ```python
   def downgrade():
       # For PostgreSQL/MySQL, you could do:
       # op.drop_column('users', 'disabled')
       # For SQLite, consider recreating the table without the column
       pass
   ```

3. **Index Consideration**: If you frequently query by `disabled` status, consider adding an index:
   ```python
   op.create_index('idx_users_disabled', 'users', ['disabled'])
   ```

### üîç Usage Context

This migration is typically used when implementing:
- User account suspension functionality
- Admin controls for disabling user access
- Soft deletion patterns for user accounts

### Running the Migration

```bash
# Apply this migration
alembic upgrade head

# Rollback (note: this won't actually remove the column due to SQLite limitations)
alembic downgrade 20250523_user_cols
```
