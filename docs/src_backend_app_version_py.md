# DocAI-IMAGE Version Configuration

## Overview

This module provides version management and release tracking functionality for the DocAI-IMAGE application. It serves as a centralized location for version information, release notes, and feature tracking across different releases of the document processing system.

## Purpose

- **Version Control**: Maintains current version information and release metadata
- **Release Documentation**: Stores comprehensive release notes and feature descriptions
- **Feature Tracking**: Documents new features and technical changes across versions
- **API Integration**: Provides programmatic access to version and release information

## Module Variables

### Core Version Information
- `__version__`: Current application version (`"0.92.0"`)
- `__release_date__`: Current release date (`"2025-05-30"`)
- `__release_name__`: Current release name (`"Document Processing Rule Engine"`)

### Version History
- `VERSION_HISTORY`: List containing detailed information about all releases, including:
  - Version numbers and dates
  - Release names and descriptions
  - Feature lists
  - Technical changes

## Functions

### `get_version()`
Returns the current version string.

```python
version = get_version()
# Returns: "0.92.0"
```

### `get_release_info()`
Returns comprehensive information about the current release.

```python
release_info = get_release_info()
# Returns: {
#     "version": "0.92.0",
#     "date": "2025-05-30", 
#     "name": "Document Processing Rule Engine"
# }
```

### `get_version_history()`
Returns the complete version history with all releases.

```python
history = get_version_history()
# Returns: Complete VERSION_HISTORY list
```

### `get_latest_features()`
Extracts and returns the feature list from the most recent release.

```python
features = get_latest_features()
# Returns: List of features from version 0.92.0
```

### `get_latest_changes()`
Extracts and returns the technical changes from the most recent release.

```python
changes = get_latest_changes()
# Returns: List of technical changes from version 0.92.0
```

## Current Release Highlights (v0.92.0)

### Key Features
- **Visual Rule Builder**: Drag-and-drop interface for creating processing rules
- **Smart Automation**: AI-powered document classification and tenant assignment
- **Real-time Processing Monitor**: Live dashboard for monitoring document processing
- **Rule Analytics**: Usage statistics and performance tracking
- **Multi-condition Evaluation**: Flexible rule conditions with various operators

### Technical Implementation
- New `processing_rules` database table with 13-column schema
- `RuleEvaluator` component for condition processing
- `RuleActionExecutor` for automated workflow actions
- 8 comprehensive API endpoints for rule management
- Integration with existing document processing pipeline

## Version History Summary

| Version | Date | Release Name | Key Focus |
|---------|------|--------------|-----------|
| 0.92.0 | 2025-05-30 | Document Processing Rule Engine | Rule-based automation |
| 0.91.0 | 2025-05-27 | Vendor Analytics Feature | Analytics and insights |

## Usage Notes

### For Developers
- Import this module to access version information programmatically
- Use `get_release_info()` for application headers or about dialogs
- Leverage `get_latest_features()` for release announcements

### For Deployment
- Version information can be used for deployment tracking
- Release notes provide context for feature rollouts
- Change logs help with debugging and support

## Suggestions

### Code Improvements
- Consider adding version comparison utilities (e.g., `is_newer_version()`)
- Add semantic versioning validation
- Include deprecation notices for future releases

### Documentation Enhancements
- Add breaking changes section to version history
- Include migration guides for major version updates
- Consider adding changelog generation utilities

### Integration Ideas
```python
# Example usage in application startup
from version import get_version, get_release_info

def display_startup_info():
    info = get_release_info()
    print(f"DocAI-IMAGE v{info['version']} - {info['name']}")
    print(f"Released: {info['date']}")
```

This module serves as the single source of truth for version management in the DocAI-IMAGE application, providing both human-readable release information and programmatic access to version data.
